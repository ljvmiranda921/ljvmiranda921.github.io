        <p>Hi, I'm Lj Miranda and welcome to my blog!</p>
        <p>
            I'm currently on a short break! Taking some time off to rest,
            refresh, and recharge. I am unreachable, but for the meantime, I'll
            be publishing posts from my backlog.
        </p>
        <p>
            In this blog, I write about my interests in machine learning,
            software development, and research&mdash;so grab a cup of coffee and feel
            free to look around!
