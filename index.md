Hi, I'm Lj Miranda and welcome to my blog!

I hailed from the Philippines and currently pursuing graduate studies in Waseda
University, Japan. I'm a member of the [Furuzuki Neurocomputing Systems
Laboratory](http://www.waseda.jp/sem-hflab/nclab/), where we study various
algorithms that imitate nature.  In this blog, I write about my interests in
anything about machine learning, software development, and research.
