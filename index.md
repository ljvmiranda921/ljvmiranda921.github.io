Hi, I'm Lj Miranda and welcome to my blog!

I hailed from the Philippines and currently pursuing graduate studies in
Waseda University, Japan. I'm currently a member of the [Furuzuki Neurocomputing Systems Laboratory](http://www.waseda.jp/sem-hflab/nclab/), where we study various algorithms that imitate nature.
In this blog, I write about my interests in anything about artificial
intelligence, machine learning, software development, and data science.
