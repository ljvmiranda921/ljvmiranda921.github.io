Hi, I'm Lj Miranda and welcome to my blog!

I'm currently a Machine Learning Researcher at [Thinking Machines Data
Science](https://thinkingmachin.es/), a data science startup in the
Philippines.

Previously, I received my Masters degree from [Waseda
University](https://www.waseda.jp/top/en) and did an internship at [Preferred
Networks](https://www.preferred-networks.jp/en/). In this blog, I write about
my interests in anything about machine learning, software development, and
research.
