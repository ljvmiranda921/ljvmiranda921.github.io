        <p>Hi, I'm Lj Miranda and welcome to my blog!</p>
        <p>
            I'm currently on a short break! Taking some time-off to rest,
            refresh, and recharge. Watch this space for the next step of my
            journey.
        </p>

            In this blog, I write about my interests in machine learning,
            software development, and research—so grab a cup of coffee and feel
            free to look around!
