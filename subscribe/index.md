Hi friends, I started a *monthly* newsletter&mdash; **the Purveyor of Curiosities!**


Here, you will receive:

* Updates on new blog posts for that month with short commentaries.
* Random wonders and interesting curiosities that you'll like!
* Things I've listened, watched, and read that you'll definitely adore!

## Frequently Asked Questions

* **Why start a newsletter?** I like to keep my blog focused on technology,
 machine learning, and open source. I occasionally talk about games, but that's
 just mostly it. A newsletter allows me to share you other wonders and trinkets
 I've found in the interwebs!

* **Why Purveyor of Curiosities?** I've been fascinated with [nostalgia
    shops](https://www.atlasobscura.com/categories/purveyors-of-curiosities)
    since college. Some highlights of my early years include [UVLA & Studio
    Soup](https://www.instagram.com/uvlastore/?hl=en) in Cubao Expo and the
    [flea markets in Lille](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braderie_de_Lille). I
    relish the idea of discovery and serendipitous encounters&mdash; and I'd
    like to share that experience with you!

* **So I am just going to hear from you monthly, right?** Yes! I'd like to keep
    the pace slow for a bit so that I can give you high-quality resources. In
    the event that I decided to increase the frequency (i.e., monthly to
    biweekly), then I'll let you know so you can decide to keep your
    subscription.
