    The MLOps ecosystem is confusing! New tools pop-up almost every
    week&mdash;it's hard to keep up!  Here, I'll try to navigate the
    ever-growing MLOps tools landscape. In Part Three, I'll talk about some
    strategies for adoption.

### Footnotes

[^1]: I admit that there's some level of bias here. I describe myself as an ML Researcher that *knows* software engineering, not necessarily an ML Engineer (lol to be honest I don't know!). From my experience, I gained some validation primarily because I know how to write software, that's why I hugely advocate learning software eng'g.
[^2]: I'm well aware that I simplified these two personas (hopefully not to the point of caricature), for the roles inside a data science team differs from one company to the other. Thanks for bearing with me! If there's a better way to think about these personas so that my analysis becomes richer, please let me know in the comments below!
[^3]: I know, "People over process. Individuals and interactions over processes and tools." I want to follow a *reverse progression* of this philosophy to give myself an easier launching pad to discuss the tooling landscape.
