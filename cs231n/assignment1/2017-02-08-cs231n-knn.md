The kNN classifier consists of two stages:

- During training, the classifier takes the training data and simply remembers it
- During testing, kNN classifies every test image by comparing to all training images and transfering the labels of the k most similar training examples
- The value of k is cross-validated

In this exercise you will implement these steps and understand the basic Image Classification pipeline, cross-validation, and gain proficiency in writing efficient, vectorized code.

</pre>

We would now like to classify the test data with the kNN classifier. Recall that we can break down this process into two steps:

1. First we must compute the distances between all test examples and all train examples.
2. Given these distances, for each test example we find the k nearest examples and have them vote for the label

Lets begin with computing the distance matrix between all training and test examples. For example, if there are **Ntr** training examples and **Nte** test examples, this stage should result in a **Nte x Ntr** matrix where each element (i,j) is the distance between the i-th test and j-th train example.

First, open `cs231n/classifiers/k_nearest_neighbor.py` and implement the function `compute_distances_two_loops` that uses a (very inefficient) double loop over all pairs of (test, train) examples and computes the distance matrix one element at a time.


<?prettify?>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
# Open cs231n/classifiers/k_nearest_neighbor.py and implement
# compute_distances_two_loops.

# Test your implementation:
dists = classifier.compute_distances_two_loops(X_test)
print(dists.shape)

# Now implement the function predict_labels and run the code below:

y_test_pred = classifier.predict_labels(dists, k=1)

# Compute and print the fraction of correctly predicted examples
num_correct = np.sum(y_test_pred == y_test)
accuracy = float(num_correct) / num_test
print('Got %d / %d correct => accuracy: %f' % (num_correct, num_test, accuracy))

    Got 137 / 500 correct => accuracy: 0.274000


You should expect to see approximately `27%` accuracy. Now lets try out a larger `k`, say `k = 5`:

You should expect to see a slightly better performance than with `k = 1`.

# two matrices are similar; one of the simplest is the Frobenius norm. In case

### Cross-validation

We have implemented the k-Nearest Neighbor classifier but we set the value k = 5 arbitrarily. We will now determine the best value of this hyperparameter with cross-validation.
