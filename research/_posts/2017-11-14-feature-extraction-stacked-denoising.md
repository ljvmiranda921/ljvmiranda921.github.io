abstract: "Predicting protein functions using machine learning techniques is a major challenge in bioinformatics. Previous works address this problem by directly feeding raw data in a classifier. However, feature-space interdependence is underused, and interesting structure in the data may be left underutilized. In addition, constructing features manually is tedious and time-consuming. In this research, a stacked denoising autoencoder was implemented to extract new features automatically before classification. A gene annotation pipeline, consisting of the autoencoder and a multi-label support-vector machine, is proposed. It was tested on benchmark datasets, including the A. thaliana specie, and showed significant improvements in various metrics. This research demonstrates that adding an unsupervised phase before classification can aid in the multi-label learning of protein functions."
