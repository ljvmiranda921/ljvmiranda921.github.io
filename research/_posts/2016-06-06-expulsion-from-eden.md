abstract: "The Calauit Safari Island Park is a classic case of tampering with biodiversity, with the introduction of non-native fauna and the expulsion of the Tagbanuas as stewards of the land. Three major themes will be discussed in this paper. First of which is the overlaying theme of biodiversity. The paper will tackle what it means to have greater diversity; and its impact in ecological processes and in maintaining a state of balance and justice. The second theme will discuss intrinsic value, following the notion that entities—whether species, individuals, or things have an innate worth—regardless of human benefits. Lastly, this framework will be applied to discuss sustainable eco-tourism, especially to the management of zoos, sanctuaries, dive spots and the like, where there is significant human intervention in natural areas. The case of Calauit will be analyzed in parallel with these three themes, and a short reflection will be provided at the end."
