### Masters Thesis

My Masters thesis involves the prediction of protein functions using
autoencoder-based techniques. You can find an unpublished version of
my manuscript below:

- [Autoencoder-based Feature Extraction Techniques for Protein Function
  Prediction](https://www.dropbox.com/s/345u99e4anukj9u/main-latest.pdf?dl=0) _Masters Thesis_, Waseda University, Unpublished, June 2018.

In addition, here are some selected works during my time at the Furuzuki
Neurocomputing Systems Laboratory (NCLab) in Waseda University. Most of these
are unpublished seminar presentations and papers:
