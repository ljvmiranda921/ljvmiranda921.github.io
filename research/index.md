This page shows my research activities, both finished and ongoing. I've
attached preprints for works that have already been completed. Unfortunately,
for works with a copyright claim (e.g. IEEE), I can only provide the link
to the publisher's website. For ongoing research, I will only attach
a preliminary abstract of my work.
