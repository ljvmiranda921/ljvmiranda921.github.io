I'm broadly interested in building equitable language technologies in the
presence of severe constraints&mdash; such as the lack of data or compute.
My current research interests are **low-resource and multilingual NLP**,
**efficient NLP**, and **corpus linguistics**.

### Previous research

I used to be a bioinformatics researcher at the [Furuzuki Neurocomputing Systems Laboratory](https://www.waseda.jp/sem-hflab/nclab/index.html), working on nature-inspired algorithms and proteomics.
