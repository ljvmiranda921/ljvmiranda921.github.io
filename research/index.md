I'm broadly interested in **data-centric approaches to building language technologies at scale.**
I believe that a careful and systematic understanding of data&mdash; from its collection to its downstream influence on training&mdash; is crucial to build general-purpose language models.
More specifically, I'm interested to work on the following topics:

- **Efficient approaches to annotation**:
    Human annotations are costly. How can we reduce this cost while preserving the nuance that human annotators provide? I'm currently exploring this question in the context of human preferences in LLM post-training (RLHF).

- **Resources for multilingual NLP**: 
    No language should be left behind, especially in data. 
    I've worked on several datasets to improve the state of low-resource and multilingual NLP.
    These projects involve Filipino [datasets](https://aclanthology.org/2023.sealp-1.2/) & [tooling](https://aclanthology.org/2023.nlposs-1.1/), and [large-scale multilingual datasets](https://aclanthology.org/2024.naacl-long.243/).

- **Evaluating overlooked aspects of LLMs**:
    I am interested in evaluating less-explored aspects of LLMs, such as their [multilingual capabilities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10118) or [reward model performance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13787), which are often overlooked in mainstream discussions or research.

If you are interested in these types of work, especially in improving the state of Filipino NLP, then do not hesitate to [reach out](mailto:ljvmiranda@gmail.com). 
I'm happy to discuss research and collaborate!
