My current research interests are **low-resource and multilingual NLP**,
**efficient NLP**, and **corpus linguistics**. I'm broadly interested in how
we can build equitable language technologies in the presence of severe constraints&mdash;such as the lack of data or compute.

### Masters Thesis

I used to be a bioinformatics researcher. My thesis involves the
prediction of protein functions using autoencoder-based techniques. You can find
a version of my manuscript below:

  Prediction](https://www.dropbox.com/s/345u99e4anukj9u/main-latest.pdf?dl=0) _Masters Thesis_, Waseda University, Unpublished, June 2018.

In addition, here are some selected works during my time at the [Furuzuki
Neurocomputing Systems Laboratory
(NCLab)](https://www.waseda.jp/sem-hflab/nclab/index.html) in [Waseda
University](https://www.waseda.jp/top/en/). Most of these are unpublished seminar presentations and reports:
