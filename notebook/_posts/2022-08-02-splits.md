    Have you ever encountered a problem where your model works well in your test
    set but doesn't perform well in the wild? It's likely because your test set
    does not reflect the reality of your domain, overestimating our model's
    performance. In this blog post, I'll discuss alternative ways to split data
    and examine their effect on named-entity recognition (NER) benchmarks.

    Have you ever encountered a problem where your model works well in your test
    set but doesn't perform well in the wild? It's likely because your test set
    does not reflect the reality of your domain, overestimating our model's
    performance. In this blog post, I'll discuss alternative ways to split data
    and examine their effect on named-entity recognition (NER) benchmarks.

<span class="firstcharacter">F</span>irst, let's recap a typical data science
workflow: every project starts by splitting our data into train, development
(dev), and test partitions. Then we fit our model using the train and dev sets
and compute the score using a held-out test set. 

Most of the time, we shuffle our data before splitting, creating **random
splits**. For some benchmark datasets like
[MNIST](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) or
[OntoNotes 5.0](https://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2013T19), these partitions are
already included in the task, providing us with **standard splits**. 

However, it turns out that random and standard splits can lead to **test sets
that are not wholly representative of the actual domain** ([Gorman and Bedrick,
2019](#gorman2019standard), and [Søgaard et. al., 2021](#sogaard2021random)).
It's also possible that the training and test sets look very similar,
encouraging the model to memorize the training set without actually learning
anything ([Goldman et al., 2022](#goldman2022morph)). This behavior results in overestimated performances that don't
translate well into production.

This blog post discusses **alternative ways to split datasets** to provide
more realistic performance. I will call all methods under this umbrella
**alternative splits**. I'll also investigate how alternative splits
affect model performance on the named-entity recognition (NER) task using
[spaCy's transition-based NER](https://spacy.io/api/entityrecognizer) and the
WikiNeural, WNUT17, and ConLL-2003 datasets.

We will discuss the following splitting methods:
1. [**Spliting by maximizing divergence**](#splitting-by-maximizing-divergence):
    where we try to find a combination of train and test splits that maximizes
    their differences. We'll look into a work that uses Wasserstein distance and a k-nearest
    neighbor search to approximate the split.
2. [**Splitting by heuristic**](#splitting-by-heuristic): where we explore ways
    to split a dataset based on its characteristics. We will specifically look into
    splitting a document by its [length](#document-length) and [morphological features](#morphological-features).
3. [**Splitting by perturbation**](#splitting-by-heuristic): where we examine how
    augmenting / perturbing the test set can lead to different model performances.
    Here, we'll use an entity switch technique and replace entities with
    counterparts from a different country or locale.

> I want to take this opportunity to introduce a Python package that

## Splitting by maximizing divergence

A central assumption in machine learning is that the **training and test sets
are from the same distribution**, i.e., they are [independent and identically
distributed
(i.i.d.)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_and_identically_distributed_random_variables) ([Gilmer, 2020](#gilmer2020robustness)).
But let's drop that for a moment. We know that the i.i.d. assumption can lead to
grossly overestimated model performances, but what if we evaluate the model
with the **"worst" possible test set?**

We can obtain the "worst" test set by ensuring that the train and test sets
have different distributions, i.e., they're wholly divergent. In literature,
this mode of splitting is called **adversarial splits**. We can measure this
value using a metric called the [Wasserstein
distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wasserstein_metric). However, finding
the right combination of train and test examples that maximizes this metric is
an NP-hard problem, so [Sogaaard et al.  (2021)](#sogaard2021random) used an
approximate approach involving k-nearest neighbors with a ball-tree algorithm.

If we run this method through the three datasets above, we can observe a short
drop in test performance (measured by the Precision / Recall / F-score, lower
values are **highlighted**):


| Dataset              | Standard Split (P/R/F) | Wasserstein Split (P/R/F) |
|----------------------|------------------------|---------------------------|
| WikiNEuRal (English) | $$~0.87~/~0.86~/~0.87$$     |  $$\mathbf{0.82~/~0.79~/~0.81}$$     |
| WNUT17               | $$0.47~/~0.45~/~0.46$$     | $$\mathbf{0.41~/~0.25~/~0.31}$$    |
| CoNLL 2003 (English) | $$0.86~/~0.86~/~0.86$$     | $$\mathbf{0.87~/~0.84~/~0.85}$$    |

Below you'll find the [displaCy output](https://spacy.io/usage/visualizers) from
ConLL 2003's adversarial test split. I admit that I *cherry-picked* some of
these examples, but one apparent pattern I saw is the presence of numbers
(currencies, dates, scores) in the adversarial test set. One possible explanation is
that the k-nearest neighbors search [uses token counts as its
feature](https://github.com/google-research/google-research/blob/master/talk_about_random_splits/probing/probing_utils.py#L152),
dividing the dataset based on token frequency.

- **Example 1:** A text with unusual formatting. The way the text laid out the scores in this
sports news article made it a bit incomprehensible.

    </div>
    <br/>

- **Example 2:** Financial text with a lot of currencies and dates. The WikiNEuRal dataset only
has `PER`, `ORG`, `LOC`, and `MISC` as its entity types.

    <div style="position:relative; overflow: hidden; width;100%; padding-top: 56.25%">
    <iframe src="/assets/png/splits/wasserstein-sample-01.html" height="300" width="720" style="border:1px solid #ddd;border-radius:10px;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;bottom:0;right:0;width:100%;height:100%"></iframe>
    </div>
    <br/>

- **Example 3:** Similar to the previous example, with dates, currencies, and other numerical
text.

    <div style="position:relative; overflow: hidden; width;100%; padding-top: 56.25%">
    <iframe src="/assets/png/splits/wasserstein-sample-02.html" height="300" width="720" style="border:1px solid #ddd;border-radius:10px;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;bottom:0;right:0;width:100%;height:100%"></iframe>
    </div>
    <br/>

## Splitting by heuristic

This section will discuss how we can **split datasets using various heuristics**
such as a document's *length* or *morphological features*.  Unlike the previous
approach, where we treat the splitting process as an optimization problem,
"splitting by heuristic" takes advantage of domain-expertise to create an
alternative test set.

### Document length

For example, *document length* can be a valuable feature to gauge how well a
machine learning model adapts to cross-sentence information in NER. Longer sentences
can provide more context as to what type of entity a particular token is.

<div style="position:relative; overflow: hidden; width;100%; padding-top: 26.25%">
<iframe src="/assets/png/splits/context_example.html" height="100" width="720" style="border:1px solid #ddd;border-radius:10px;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;bottom:0;right:0;width:100%;height:100%"></iframe>
</div>
<br/>

In the example above, we know that the token `McKinley` can refer to either a
location (`LOC`) or a person (`PER`). Because of the context sentence, *"...was
named after William McKinley"*, the model had a better idea of what type of
entity the second instance of `McKinley` is. The works of [Luoma and Pyysalo
(2020)](#luoma2020cross), [Arora et al. (2021)](#arora2021typed), and
[Siegelmann and Sontag (1992)](#siegelmann1992nets) explores how well NER models
can take advantage of such cross-sentence information.

In our case, **we'll split the dataset so that the longer sentences are in the
test split.** Similar to [Sogaard et al's (2021)](#sogaard2021random) approach,
we choose a threshold so that $$10\%$$ of the documents will be found in the
test set. After training a transition-based NER on this new split, the results
are as follows (lower values are **highlighted**):

| Dataset              | Threshold | Standard Split (P/R/F) | Split by Length (P/R/F)   |
|----------------------|-----------|------------------------|---------------------------|
| WikiNEuRal (English) |    $$38$$ | $$0.87~/~0.86~/~0.87$$      |  $$\mathbf{0.84~/~0.85~/~0.85}$$     |
| WNUT17               |    $$29$$     | $$\mathbf{0.47}~/~0.45~/~\mathbf{0.46}$$     | $$0.58~/~\mathbf{0.42}~/~0.49$$    |
| CoNLL 2003 (English) |    $$446$$    | $$0.86~/~0.86~/~0.86$$    | $$\mathbf{0.78~/~0.84~/~0.81}$$    |

It's interesting why there's not much change in the WNUT17 score. We can even
say that the split improved the performance! I hypothesize that the token-length
difference between the training and test is not that apparent given the
distribution. This means that the split may not be as biased as we want it to be
and just looks like a random split.

{:style="text-align: center;"}

Here are some examples from the new WNUT17 test split:

- **Example 1:** A text with token length 105. This document is one of the top 5 longest texts in the WNUT17 dataset.

    <div style="position:relative; overflow: hidden; width;100%; padding-top: 52.25%">
    <iframe src="/assets/png/splits/doclength-sample-01.html" height="100" width="720" style="border:1px solid #ddd;border-radius:10px;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;bottom:0;right:0;width:100%;height:100%"></iframe>
    </div>
    <br/>

- **Example 2:** A text with token length 72. There seems to be an error in
annotation. The text looks like a Tweet, but the token `@Xantec` was mislabeled
as a `product` instead of a `person`.

    <div style="position:relative; overflow: hidden; width;100%; padding-top: 48.25%">
    <iframe src="/assets/png/splits/doclength-sample-02.html" height="100" width="720" style="border:1px solid #ddd;border-radius:10px;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;bottom:0;right:0;width:100%;height:100%"></iframe>
    </div>
    <br/>

### Morphological Features

We can also split datasets based on the presence of morphological features and
inflections.  Recall that words have a base form *(lemma)*, whose structure
changes *(inflected)* based on their role and function. For example, consider
the sentence, "She was reading the paper," if we run [spaCy's
Morphologizer](https://spacy.io/usage/linguistic-features#morphology), we
obtain:

```python
import spacy
nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm")
text = "She was reading the paper"
doc = nlp(text)
for token in doc:
    print(token.text, " - ",  token.lemma_, " - ",  token.morph)

# She  -  she  -  Case=Nom|Gender=Fem|Number=Sing|Person=3|PronType=Prs
# was  -  be  -  Mood=Ind|Number=Sing|Person=3|Tense=Past|VerbForm=Fin
# reading  -  read  -  Aspect=Prog|Tense=Pres|VerbForm=Part
# the  -  the  -  Definite=Def|PronType=Art
# paper  -  paper  -  Number=Sing
```
The lemma, `read`, is modified into `reading` to express the progressive aspect
(`Aspect=Prog`), and the present tense (`Tense=Pres`). The same can be said to
the lemma, `she`, where it's a third-person singular noun
(`Person=3|Number=Sing`) of the feminine gender (`Gender=Fem`).[^1]

The idea then is that if we **split a dataset based on its morphological
features**, e.g., put all singular nouns (`Number=Sing`) or masculine gender
(`Gender=Masc`) in the training set; then perhaps we can better diagnose if our
models are robust against these inflections.

[^1]: You can see the full taxonomy of morphological features in the [UniMorph paper](https://unimorph.github.io/doc/unimorph-schema.pdf).

This is exactly what I did. By separating a few arbitrarily chosen features (I
admit a lot of experimentation is still needed for this), I created a train-test
split based on a document's morphological inflections. In this case, I made sure
that atleast $$10\%$$ of the samples end up in the test set. The results are as
follows (lowers values are **highlighted**):

| Dataset              | Standard Split (P/R/F) | Morphological Split (P/R/F) |
|----------------------|------------------------|---------------------------|
| WikiNEuRal (English) | $$0.87~/~0.86~/~0.87$$     |  $$\mathbf{0.72~/~0.76~/~0.73}$$     |
| WNUT17               | $$0.47~/~0.45~/~0.46$$     | $$\mathbf{0.29~/~0.33~/~0.31}$$    |
| CoNLL 2003 (English) | $$0.86~/~0.86~/~0.86$$     | $$\mathbf{0.72~/~0.69~/~0.71}$$    |

- **Example 1:** A document from the new test set where tokens with a morph feature
    of `Gender=Fem` were separated.

    <div style="position:relative; overflow: hidden; width;100%; padding-top: 52.25%">
    <iframe src="/assets/png/splits/morph-sample-01.html" height="100" width="720" style="border:1px solid #ddd;border-radius:10px;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;bottom:0;right:0;width:100%;height:100%"></iframe>
    </div>
    <br/>

- **Example 2:** This is an interesting example because
    even if the majority of the sentence has a male-quoted text, it was still
    included in the test set because there's no named entity for the masculine
    gender.

    <div style="position:relative; overflow: hidden; width;100%; padding-top: 52.25%">
    <iframe src="/assets/png/splits/morph-sample-00.html" height="100" width="720" style="border:1px solid #ddd;border-radius:10px;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;bottom:0;right:0;width:100%;height:100%"></iframe>
    </div>
    <br/>


## Splitting by perturbation

Lastly, we can split datasets by **perturbing the test set.** In this section,
we'll focus on **entity switching** or substituting specific entities with
counterparts from a different locale or region. It is not strictly a split because
we're just updating entities. We may even consider this method a
combination of the first two, i.e., applying heuristics to maximize the divergence
between training and test sets.

[Agarwal, Yang, et al. (2020)](#agarwal2020switch) used this approach to audit the
**in-domain robustness of NER models.** They replaced specific entities in the ConLL
2003 dataset with the same type but of different national origin. They
discovered that some systems performed best in American and Indian entities and
worst in Vietnamese and Indonesian entities. For example, **using BERT subwords on
ConLL 2003 reduced the NER F-score from $$94.4$$ to $$88.2$$ when using
Vietnamese entities.** It's an interesting study that demonstrates how biased some
NER systems are.

I tried replicating the entity-switched ConLL 2003 dataset they used, but I had
difficulty reproducing them from their [Github
repository](https://github.com/oagarwal/entity-switched-ner).  So instead, I
used the [name-dataset library](https://github.com/philipperemy/name-dataset) to
get a random sample of Indonesian and Filipino names,[^2] then substituted them into
our three datasets. Below are the results:

[^2]: 

    I chose Filipino because the `name-dataset` library doesn't contain
    Vietnamese names. Although Filipino names differ in structure (usually a
    Spanish or American first name followed by an English surname), they're
    still in the Southeast Asian region, and it's worth trying if Agarwal, Yang,
    et al.'s hypothesis still holds.


| Dataset              | Standard Split (P/R/F) | Entity Switch (P/R/F) |
|----------------------|------------------------|---------------------------|
| WikiNEuRal (English) | $$0.87~/~0.86~/~0.87$$     |  $$\mathbf{0.85~/~0.82~/~0.83}$$     |
| WNUT17               | $$\mathbf{0.47}~/~0.45~/~0.46$$     | $$0.65~/~\mathbf{0.26}~/~\mathbf{0.37}$$    |
| CoNLL 2003 (English) | $$0.86~/~0.86~/~0.86$$     | $$\mathbf{0.86~/~0.79~/~0.82}$$    |

Switching entities caused a drop in performance. Note that I'm not even precise
with how I substituted `PERSON` names, i.e., I didn't consider if it's a full
name or first name, and I didn't regard the name's gender.  Nevertheless,
creating this split still caused issues with the transition-based NER parser.
Below is an example:

- **Example 1:** A sports news report where all player names are replaced with
    Southeast Asian names. Note that the switch here doesn't take context into
    consideration. The article mentions "Italy" but the names aren't from that
    nationality.

    <div style="position:relative; overflow: hidden; width;100%; padding-top: 52.25%">
    <iframe src="/assets/png/splits/switch-sample-00.html" height="100" width="720" style="border:1px solid #ddd;border-radius:10px;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;bottom:0;right:0;width:100%;height:100%"></iframe>
    </div>
    <br/>

## Final thoughts

In this blog post, we examined the scenario where a typical train-test split may
overestimate a model's performance, thereby causing it to underperform in the
wild. As it turns out, even standard NLP benchmarks can fall into this trap. 

We then introduced three alternative splits: **splitting by maximizing
divergence**, in this case by optimizing the Wasserstein distance, **splitting
by heuristics** such as document length and morphological features, and 
**splitting by perturbation**, as illustrated by entity-switching. We tested
these methods in three NER datasets to test spaCy's transition-based NER system. We
learned that **robustness is still an issue** given these benchmarks.

I think the best that we can do as machine learning practitioners is to create
systems that allow *checks and balances* to ML systems. This might mean creating
tools to measure robustness, reporting failure modes, and evaluating a model on
a diverse set of samples. We're still a long way to fully solve this problem,
but acknowledging that it exists is a big step forward.
