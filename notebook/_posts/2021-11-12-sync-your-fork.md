TL;DR&mdash;here's [what I'll do](#what-i-do).


Whenever I work on open-source projects, I usually maintain my own copy, a
[*fork*](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo), of the
original codebase. Then, when I propose changes, I open up a [Pull
Request
(PR)](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests).

When my PR receives a maintainer's approval, the commits from my fork will
happily live inside the original repository; all is good. However, there are
cases when a maintainer merges not via a merge commit, but by squashing or
rebasing my changes.[^1]

During a rebase, commits are "rewritten" even with the same
[diff](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/saving-changes/git-diff). Git
cannot put two and two together, so it will treat my commits as unique.

Now, when I make a new Pull Request for a different issue, those commits
will persist! In Github, this messes the Pull Request interface (i.e.,
"why do I have commits for fixing Issue 1 when this PR is about Issue 2?").

To add, Github's "Fetch upstream" button performs a
[merge](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/using-branches/git-merge),
making further Pull Requests dirty and riddled with stray commits&mdash;the
worst case is to delete my fork and copy it again.


## What I do

What I do is **maintain a link to the original repository and track the changes
from there.** Before making a PR, I make sure to rebase those new changes to my
fork. 

First, let's create a link to the original remote. You can call it
`upstream`, `orig` or whatever you want:

```sh
$ git remote add upstream https://github.com/com/original/original.git
```

You now have *two* remotes: one for your fork, and one for the original
repository. If you run `git remote -v`, you will see the following:

```sh
$ git remote -v
origin https://github.com/myusername/myfork.git (fetch)
origin https://github.com/myusername/myfork.git (push)
upstream https://github.com/original/original.git (fetch)
upstream https://github.com/original/original.git (push)
```

Then, I track the remote branches by fetching them from the upstream:

```sh
$ git fetch upstream
```

Lastly, I go back to my fork's default branch (usually it's `master` or
`main`) then rebase the upstream's changes to this branch.

```sh
$ git checkout main
$ git rebase upstream/main
```

To fully sync my fork, I push the changes from my local to my remote:  

```sh
$ git push origin +main
```

The `+` sign means that it's a force push. It overwrites whatever you have in
your remote and rewrites the history to be similar as the original repo. You
will achieve similar results if you pass an `-f` parameter like so: 

```sh
# Same as above
$ git push -f origin main
```

And that's it! Our fork is now fully-synced with the original repository. The
commits should match one-to-one, without merge commits nor strays .[^2] This is
helpful to ensure that my fork is up-to-date with the codebase. 

Hope you learned something new today!

    interested in the differences between merging and rebasing.

    Another thing that I do is to **make a Pull Request using my fork's feature
    branch**, not through `main`. With this method, I ensure that my `main`
    branch is always "clean."
