<!-- short summary of what we have so far from Parts One and Two -->


## Conclusion 

### Are notebooks here to stay?

I opened up this series with the statement: 

> "Ah, Jupyter Notebooks. Love it or hate it, they're here to stay." 

Given what we know and what we've learned so far, let's revisit this assertion
and see if it holds ground. I'd approach this in a two-fold manner: first, with
Notebooks as a programming paradigm, and second, with Notebooks as the
technology itself (i.e., Jupyter Notebooks by Project Jupyter).

<!-- Notebooks aren't a new concept, you can see them as an offshoot of
literate programming -->


<!-- As a paradigm, it's here to stay -->


<!-- As a technology, the space will get diluted -->


### My wishlist 

<!-- 1. Make Restart Kernel and Run All a first-class citizen -->

<!-- 2. Notebook IDEs -->

<!-- 3. Integrate with virtual environments for easier kernel switching -->


<!-- 4. A cell-lock mode? -->

<!-- 5. A user-friendly way for cell testing -->


### Final thoughts


<!-- I wrote this essay because... my blogpost back in 2018 is outdated -->
<!-- personally, i love notebooks and they don't deserve the animosity they get -->
<!-- there's a right tool for the job. -->
