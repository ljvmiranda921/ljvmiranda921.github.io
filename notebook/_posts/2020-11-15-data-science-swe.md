Hello, you're probably here because I linked this to you after I rambled on how
you can improve your software skills as a researcher. Maybe our conversation
went this way:

> Learn git! Modularize your code! Then uhm, try to reproduce your
> experiments along the way, also deploy your stuff to some cloud platforms
> along the way? Try using notebookes less often, Also, check PEP8! And learn git!

You get it already...The field is quite huge and you can get started in so many
ways&mdash; I too got overwhelmed before. *However*, as an opinionated
advice, I think that there's one activity/exercise that introduces you to all 
relevant skills and focus them into a tangible output:


> Dockerize a

<!-- show the final product in illustration form: a fully-fledged machine -->

## Wait, why?


## Ok, so what should I do?

<!-- this is the how, when illustrating these things, build-up the "final
machine" -->
<!-- learn git => learn the tools -->
<!-- learn how to modularize your code => show that the components now look
better -->
<!-- learn flask => an interface for the machine -->
<!-- learn docker => the "frame" or the common interface into which these
things will fit in -->






## Conclusion
