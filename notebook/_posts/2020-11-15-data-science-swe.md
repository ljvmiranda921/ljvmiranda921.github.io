    I meet a lot of data scientists who would like to improve their software
    engineering (SWE) skills&mdash;to go beyond Notebooks and streamline
    productization of their models. In this blogpost, I'd like to talk about a
    simple litmus test that once accomplished, is indicative of a baseline SWE
    skill in the data science industry.
