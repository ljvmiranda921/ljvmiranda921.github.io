    I meet a lot of data scientists who would like to improve their software
    engineering (SWE) skills&mdash;to go beyond Notebooks and streamline
    productization of their models. In this blogpost, I'd like to talk about a
    simple litmus test that once accomplished, is indicative of a baseline SWE
    skill in the data science industry.

## Introduction

Whenever someone asks me how to improve their software engineering (SWE) skills
as a data scientist, I find it difficult to give an answer. The field of
software engineering is broad, and there's a lot of things to learn. However,
if we narrow it down to the most common software use-case for machine learning,
then it becomes easier.

In this blogpost, I'll talk about an indicative test for software engineering
in ML. It is **project-based**, and demands a combination of relevant SWE skills
pointing towards a specific goal. Accomplishing the test will **show baseline
competence, but not necessarily mastery.** 





## The Test

### Why a Machine Learning API?

### How to make a Machine Learning API?


## Conclusion
