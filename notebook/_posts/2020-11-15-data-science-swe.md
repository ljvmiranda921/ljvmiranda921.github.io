    I meet a lot of data scientists who would like to expand their skillset to
    include basic software engineering, i.e., to go beyond Notebooks and
    streamline productization of their models. In this blogpost, I'd like to
    describe a simple litmus test that once accomplished, is indicative of 
    basic SWE skill in the data science industry.

<!-- Might sound self aggrandizing? reword litmus test? -->
<!-- Might sound airy even if in the grand scheme of things the project is simple -->
<!-- Talk about improvement or a simple project to introduce yourself in data science SWE -->
<!-- Disclaimer, very easy. There are some process improvements that should still be done -->
<!-- Goal, improvement of engineering sense: thinking about latency, DRY principles, security? -->


## Introduction

Whenever someone asks me how to improve their software engineering (SWE) skills
as a researcher or data scientist, I find it difficult to give an answer. The
field of software engineering is broad, and there's a lot of things to learn.
However, if we narrow it down to the most common software use-case for machine
learning, then it becomes easier.

In this blogpost, I'll talk about an indicative test for software engineering
in ML. It is **project-based**, and demands a combination of relevant SWE
skills pointing towards a specific goal. Accomplishing the test will **show
baseline competence, but not necessarily mastery.** 

## The Test
