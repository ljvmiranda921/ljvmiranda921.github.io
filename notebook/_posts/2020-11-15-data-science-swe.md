Hello, you're probably here because I linked this after I rambled upon how
someone can improve their software skills as a researcher. Maybe our conversation
went this way:

<!-- illustrate this instead?? -->

> along the way? Try using notebookes less often, Also, check PEP8! And learn git!"

You get it already...the field is quite huge and you can get started in so many
ways&mdash; I got overwhelmed before. *However*, as an opinionated
advice, I think that there's one activity/exercise that introduces you to all 
relevant skills and focus them into a tangible output:

> Create a machine learning application that can receive HTTP requests
> and can optionally be deployed as a containerized app.


That's quite a mouthful, let's break it down a bit:
* **"Create a machine learning application..."**
* **"...that can receive HTTP requests..."**
* **"...can optionally be deployed..."**
* **"...as a containerized app."**


<!-- show the final product in illustration form: a fully-fledged machine -->

## Wait, why?

<!-- industry application: ML is a component of a system -->
<!-- pedagogical application: will teach you the relevant parts -->
<!-- personal application: you can reuse images not just to coord with other's
code, but also to make deployable stuff for demos, fun things, etc. -->

## Ok, so what should I do?

<!-- this is the how, when illustrating these things, build-up the "final
machine" -->
<!-- for each point, write down what should they learn or the activities that
they should do + relevant resources: in learn git {learn
proper commit messages, learn git flow, etc.} -->

<!-- learn git => learn the tools -->
<!-- learn how to modularize your code => show that the components now look
better -->
<!-- learn flask => an interface for the machine -->
<!-- learn docker => the "frame" or the common interface into which these
things will fit in -->



## What's next?

<!-- if they enjoyed this, they can now do a lot of things: deployment,
devops,e tc. --> 
<!-- maybe there's an illustrative component for each? -->
<!-- more ways to improve the app -->
