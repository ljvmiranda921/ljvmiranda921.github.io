    Avengers and Git? The most ambitious crossover event in history
---


<span class="firstcharacter">W</span>hen I first watched *Avengers: Endgame* in
theaters, I noticed that **their time travel rule is quite similar to the Git
branching model.** Referred to as the [*time
heist*](https://marvelcinematicuniverse.fandom.com/wiki/Time_Heist), our heroes
travelled through time to recover the stones and undo the effects of the
snap&mdash; thereby saving all.

Back to the future isn't necessarily BS, 
Then this conversation between the Ancient One and Banner drove the point home
for me:

Creating branches and alternate realities...*isn't that vaguely familiar with
Git?* In fact, **the time heist itself is similar to retrieving a deleted file
in Git!** 

Let me demonstrate that in this blogpost.

<b>Spoilers alert!</b><br>
Really now, you haven't watched Avengers: Infinity War and Avengers: Endgame? </p>



## The story so far

The end of *Avengers: Infinity War* left our heroes defeated, with Thanos
successfully finishing his conquest to create balance in the universe:


```sh
$ python infinity_gauntlet/snap.py balance --probs=0.5 --no-dry-run
```

Oh yeah I forgot:

```sh
$ rm -rf gamora loki just_the_entire_planet_of_xandar
```




```sh
$ python infinity_gauntlet/snap.py destroy-stones --all --no-dry-run
$ git rm .
$ git commit -m "Use the stones to destroy the stones"
```


## Time Heist

One of the most interesting decisions in Endgame is on how they played around
the concept of 

> The past becomes your future and the present becomes your past



<!-- Recovering the stones -->



<!-- Defeating Thanos -->


<!--

I focused solely on the time heist because the git model still can't explain:
* How Steve was married to Peggy all along. 
* How Doctor Strange can see multiple points in the future

* Pleaaaase, in an actual work setting, please don't write git commits this way
Instead, I will point you to chris beam's famous article on writing better commit messages

* So Thanos codes in Python? He's probably the guy who likes dynamically-typed languages, but still adds
type hints in his parameter arguments. Anyway, to make the CLI, I believe he's using click.
