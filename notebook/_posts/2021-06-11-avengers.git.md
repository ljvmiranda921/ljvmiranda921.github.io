    Avengers and Git? The most ambitious crossover event in history

In this blogpost, I will explain the Time Heist using the git branching model.


<!-- The story so far -->

## The story so far


```sh
$: tree .
.
├── collector
│   └── reality
├── doctor_strange
│   └── time
├── loki
│   └── space
├── nova_corps
│   └── power
└── vision
    └── mind
```


<!-- Thanos conquest -->

## The conquest of Thanos

```sh
$ mkdir infinity_gauntlet
$ mv loki/space infinity_gauntlet
$ mv collector/reality infinity_gauntlet
$ mv nova_corps/power infinity_gauntlet
$ git commit -m "Fine, I'll do it myself"
```

Oops, I forgot something

```sh
$ rm -rf loki collector nova_corps
$ git commit -m "Destiny arrives all the same"
```

Then to get the soul stone

```sh
$ curl https://vormir.com/sacrifice?name=gamora --output soul
```

Oh yeah, I forgot:

```sh
$ rm -rf gamora
$ git commit -m "I am sorry, little one"
```





### Deleting the stones

```sh
$ mv vision/mind infinity_gauntlet
$ mv doctor_strange/time infinity_gauntlet
```

```sh
$ python infinity_gauntlet/snap.py balance --probs=0.5 --no-dry-run
```


```sh
$ python infinity_gauntlet/snap.py destroy-stones --all --no-dry-run
$ git rm .
$ git commit -m "Use the stones to destroy the stones"
```


## Time Heist

At this point, we haven't even scratched the surface of the git model. In fact,
it all jives beautifully 


<!-- Recovering the stones -->



<!-- Defeating Thanos -->


<!--

I focused solely on the time heist because the git model still can't explain:
* How Steve was married to Peggy all along. 
* How Doctor Strange can see multiple points in the future

* Pleaaaase, in an actual work setting, please don't write git commits this way
Instead, I will point you to chris beam's famous article on writing better commit messages

* So Thanos codes in Python? He's probably the guy who likes dynamically-typed languages, but still adds
type hints in his parameter arguments. Anyway, to make the CLI, I believe he's using click.
