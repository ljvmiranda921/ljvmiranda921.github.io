<!-- what is DRG -->
<span class="firstcharacter">D</span>*eep Rock Galactic* (DRG) is a coop shooter where
you play the role of a space dwarf employed in the titular mining corporation.
You kill hordes of bugs, traverse procedurally-generated caverns, and drink
mountain loads of beer. You can choose from four classes, each with different
playstyles and weapons.  Within each class, you can even create specific
loadouts that change how a weapon behaves. It's a fun game with a friendly
community&mdash;and I've spent 600 hours in it so far.

**Build variety helps with the game's longevity.** One way DRG achieves this is
*through overclocks*. They can be equipped to a weapon to modify their stats or
drastically change
their playstyle. For example, I can slot a [Gunner's
minigun](https://deeprockgalactic.fandom.com/wiki/%22Lead_Storm%22_Powered_Minigun)
with an overclock that allows me to burn nearby enemies (Bullet Hell) or
significantly increase damage at the cost of mobility (Lead Storm).  Coupled
with a weapon's built-in modifications, the possibilities are endless!

__Figure:__ A loadout screen in DRG. On the right, you'll see five tiers of gear
modifications ("mods") to customize your stats. Mods are often denoted as
letters based on their order: e.g., BAAAC. The red icon below represents an overclock.

With the sheer number of possible loadouts, the community created a platform
called [**Karl.GG**](https://karl.gg) where players can share and discuss their
builds.  Given the data available in the website, I'm interested in the
following questions:

- *Which builds tend to get the most attention?* I'm curious if there are
    particular overclocks or builds the community coalesce into. 
- *How do players build their traversal and support tools?* DRG's traversal and
    support system is a masterpiece of game design.  It encourages players to work
    together to solve challenges. I'm interested to see how most Karl.GG users
    modify their traversal tools in practice.
- *Can different weapons be similar stat-wise?* Although every weapon has its
    own feel (e.g., from missile launchers to an M1 Garand), I'm curious if their
    stats (damage, rate of fire, etc.) are spread out when built in a particular
    manner.


## Getting the data

I got a data dump from [MeatShield](https://karl.gg/profile/18#/), one of the
core developers of Karl.GG. The dump encompasses all builds created until the
date of November 19, 2022:

{: style="text-align: center;"}

However, it doesn't have the number of salutes (or
upvotes) for a given build. So I wrote a [scraper]() and used MeatShield's data
for validation and for perfoming an inner join.
This gives us a total of **14,193 builds** from May 7, 2020 to November 19, 2022.
Before we proceed with the analysis, I just want to mention a few caveats and assumptions:
- Karl.GG doesn't keep a history of builds in between patches. So if a build
    gets updated in a new patch (where weapons get rebalanced), I will assume that
    it was optimized for that patch. 
- The number of builds in Karl.GG doesn't always mean that it's popular in-game.
    There's no way to know for sure. For this analysis, I'll treat it as a proxy for
    popularity. In the same vein, I'll treat upvotes ("salutes") as a proxy for
    loadout quality (e.g. ""*hey, I tried this build and it's a good one!"*)

With that out of the way, let's head to the analysis!
