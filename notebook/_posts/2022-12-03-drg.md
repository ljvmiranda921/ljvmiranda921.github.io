<!-- what is DRG -->
<span class="firstcharacter">D</span>*eep Rock Galactic* (DRG) is a coop shooter where
you play the role of a space dwarf employed in the titular mining corporation.
You kill hordes of bugs, traverse procedurally-generated caverns, and drink
mountain loads of beer. You can choose from four classes, each with different
playstyles and weapons.  Within each class, you can even create specific
loadouts that change how a weapon behaves. It's a fun game with a friendly
community&mdash;and I've spent 600 hours in it so far.

**Build variety helps with the game's longevity.** One way DRG achieves this is
*through overclocks*. They can be equipped to a weapon to modify their stats or
drastically change
their playstyle. For example, I can slot a [Gunner's
minigun](https://deeprockgalactic.fandom.com/wiki/%22Lead_Storm%22_Powered_Minigun)
with an overclock that allows me to burn nearby enemies (Bullet Hell) or
significantly increase damage at the cost of mobility (Lead Storm).  Coupled
with a weapon's built-in modifications, the possibilities are endless!

__Figure:__ A loadout screen in DRG. On the right, you'll see five tiers of gear
modifications ("mods") to customize your stats. Mods are often denoted as
letters based on their order: e.g., BAAAC. The red icon below represents an overclock.

With the sheer number of possible loadouts, the community created a platform
called [**Karl.GG**](https://karl.gg) where players can share and discuss their
builds.  Given the data available in the website, I'm interested in the
following questions:

- [**Which builds tend to get the most attention?**](#builds) I'm curious if there are
    particular overclocks or builds the community uses more. 
- **How do players build their traversal and support tools?** DRG's traversal and
    support system is a masterpiece of game design.  It encourages players to work
    together to solve challenges. I'm interested to see how most Karl.GG users
    modify their traversal tools in practice.
- **Can different weapons be similar stat-wise?** Although every weapon has its
    own feel (e.g., from missile launchers to an M1 Garand), I'm curious if their
    stats (damage, rate of fire, etc.) are spread out when built in a particular
    manner.


## Getting the data

I got a data dump from [MeatShield](https://karl.gg/profile/18#/), one of the
core developers of Karl.GG. The dump encompasses all builds created until the
date of November 19, 2022:

![](/assets/png/drg/builds_per_class.svg){:width="620px"}
{: style="text-align: center;"}

However, it doesn't have the number of salutes (or upvotes) for a given build.
So I wrote a [scraper]() and used MeatShield's data for validation and for
performing an inner join. The dataset contains **14,193 builds** from May 7,
2020 to November 19, 2022.  Before we proceed with the analysis, I just want to
mention a few caveats and assumptions:

- Karl.GG doesn't keep a history of builds in between patches. So if a build
    gets updated in a new patch (where weapons get rebalanced), I will assume that
    the creator optimized it for that patch. 
- The number of builds in Karl.GG doesn't always mean that it's popular in-game.
    There's no way to know for sure. For this analysis, I'll treat it as a proxy for
    popularity. In the same vein, I'll treat upvotes ("salutes") as a proxy for
    loadout quality (e.g. ""*hey, I tried this build and it's a good one!"*)

With that out of the way, let's drink our [Smart
Stout](https://deeprockgalactic.fandom.com/wiki/Abyss_Bar) and head to the
analysis!

## <a id="builds"></a> Which builds tend to get the most attention?

Even if there are hundreds of loadouts in DRG, the community tends to gravitate
to a select few. In this section, I'll start by analyzing the weapons in
isolation, then on how they're paired together, and lastly go into detail with
the weapon mods and overclocks. 

In the figures below, you'll see how many builds are present for each Primary
and Secondary weapon each month (*Use the dropdown to highlight a specific
weapon*):

There are some interesting trends I want to give attention:

- **Rise of the GK2**: Scout's [Deepcore GK2](https://deeprockgalactic.fandom.com/wiki/Deepcore_GK2) (primary) has received lukewarm attention for the past few seasons (even before Season 1). However, when [Plaguefall introduced buffs](https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/548430/view/3390674748245844142) to its base stats and overclocks, the number of builds skyrocketed. GK2 is my go-to build now. It's fun to use and packs more punch.
- **Sad Subata**: Driller's [Subata 120](https://deeprockgalactic.fandom.com/wiki/Subata_120) (secondary) constantly remained at the lower rung of build popularity. It doesn't mean that it's a bad weapon. One explanation is that there may only be a few viable builds for Subata, hence the low number. 
- **U-shaped drop?**: There is a U-shaped trend for the new Season 2 secondaries. We found a lot of interest post-release, but it quickly died down in the middle of the season. However, it's starting to pick up again by the start of Season 3.

    {: style="text-align: center;"}

- **Gunner and Driller primaries trend similarly**: the DRG community often
thinks that the most "balanced" primaries belong to these classes. Looking at
the build frequencies, it seems that it holds true.

    {: style="text-align: center;"}

Right now, we're looking at each weapon in isolation. However, I'm also
interested in **how the community pairs the primary and secondary weapons
together.** Below, you'll see a heatmap for each class with their weapon
pairings. You can **hover** over each box to see the weapon combination and the
number of builds for that pair.

The most popular pairings overall are the *Gunner's Minigun with Revolver* and the
*Engineer's Shotgun with Grenade Launcher*. The least popular ones are the *Driller's
Sludge Pump with Subata* and the *Gunner's Minigun with Coilgun*. 

Now, let's head to the Overclocks (OCs). Notice how the **majority of loadouts
in Karl.GG have overclocks** in them. This pattern makes sense because DRG's
build variety shines with their presence.

<!-- overclocks -->

| Class    | Primaries (% with OC) | Secondaries (% with OC) |
|----------|-----------------------|-------------------------|
| Driller  | 94.18%                | 93.36%                  |
| Engineer | 95.32%                | 95.26%                  |
| Gunner   | 94.61%                | 95.53%                  |
| Scout    | 94.68%                | 95.50%                  |

__Table:__ A huge majority of builds in Karl.GG have overclocks.
{: style="text-align: center;"}

I'm curious if there's a difference among overclock types&mdash; clean,
balanced, and unstable. There sure is. Gunner primaries 
strongly prefer unstable overclocks, while Scout primaries favor balanced ones. 
Few builds revolve around clean overclocks, while the ratio of balanced
and unstable ones is about the same.

It's also interesting how the ratio changes regarding secondary weapons.
For example, clean overclocks dominated Scout secondaries&mdash;primarily due to
the popular Special Powder.  You can find more information in the figure below.
Hover your mouse on the bar segments to see the actual values.

Some observations:
- **Standouts.** Gunner's primary OCs revolve around Lead Storm, Burning Hell, Big
    Bertha, and NTP.  Interestingly, the least popular OC (Manual Guidance Cutoff)
    lags 10x behind the next (Thinned Drummed Walls).
- **A Song of Ice and Fire.** The leading Driller OCs are Tuned Cooler (Cryo
    Cannon) and Sticky Fuel (Flamethrower). The Sludge Pump is a new addition,
    that's why there are fewer builds in it. I appreciate that the top 2
    overclocks have different elemental properties. 
- **Balanced kit.** Engineers tend to have the most balanced number of OC
    loadouts, with a few standouts here and there. Even the Smart Rifle, a
    new addition from Season 1, already has many builds involving
    Explosive Chemical Rounds and Executioner.

Below we have the same chart but with secondary weapons:

And here are some of my observations:

- **Movement is king.** Scout's Special Powder takes a huge lead (20%) over
    Embedded Detonators (14%). It's the most common loadout in Karl.GG. Interestingly,
    Engineer's Hyper Propellant behaves the same way. These two overclocks give your character 
    new movement options, so it's understandable why so many builds incorporate them.
- **Just the revolver, please.** Most leading Gunner overclocks involve
    the revolver, with only the "Lead Spray" BRT7 in the top spot. I would even claim that a
    "Lead Spray" BRT7 build also *feels* like a revolver.
