<!-- what is DRG -->
<span class="firstcharacter">D</span>*eep Rock Galactic* is a coop shooter where
you play the role of a space dwarf employed in the titular mining corporation.
You kill hordes of bugs, traverse procedurally-generated caverns, and drink
mountain loads of beer. You can choose from four classes&mdash;Driller,
Engineer, Gunner, and Scout&mdash; each with different playstyles and weapons.
Within each class, you can even create specific loadouts that change how a
weapon behaves. It's a fun game with a friendly community, and I've spent 600 hours
in it so far.

**Build variety helps with the game's longevity.** One way the game achieves this is through
*overclocks*. They can be equipped to a weapon to modify their stats or drastically change
their playstyle. For example, I can slot a [Gunner's minigun](https://deeprockgalactic.fandom.com/wiki/%22Lead_Storm%22_Powered_Minigun) with an overclock that allows me
to burn nearby enemies (Bullet Hell) or significantly increase damage at the cost of mobility (Lead Storm).
Coupled with a weapon's built-in modifications, the possibilities are endless!

With the sheer number of possible loadouts, there is a platform called 
[**Karl.GG**](https://karl.gg) where players can share and discuss their builds.
Given the data available in the website, I'm interested in the following
questions:

- *Which builds tend to get the most attention?* I'm curious if there are
    particular overclocks or builds the community coalesce into. 
- *How do players build their traversal and support tools?* DRG's traversal and
    support system is a masterpiece of game design.  It encourages players to work
    together to solve challenges. I'm interested to see how most Karl.GG users
    modify their traversal tools in practice.
- *Can different weapons be similar stat-wise?* Although every weapon has its
    own feel (e.g., from missile launchers to an M1 Garand), I'm curious if their
    stats (damage, rate of fire, etc.) are spread out when built in a particular
    manner.


## Getting the data




### A few caveats
<!-- a few caveats -->


## Which builds tend to get the most attention? 

<!--the best part about DRG is that you can play what you want to play-->
<!-- but what are the most discussed builds? -->


### What are the most popular builds?

<!-- popular builds per class -->
<!-- popular overclocks per primary -->
<!-- popularity vs. "quality" -->

## How do players build their traversal and support tools?

### Scouts: how do you move?

<!-- with special poweder -->
<!-- without special poweder -->


### Drillers: Barbed drills or reinforced drills?

<!-- before and after Drilling in the name of video -->

### Gunners: Bigger shields or long-lasting shields?

### Engineers: When do you use Disabled Inertia Inhibitor?

## Can different weapons be similar stat-wise?

### Build2Vec


## Extra: analyzing Karl.GG

### How do build creators name their builds?

### What words do we often associate for each class?

<!--
- do this for (1) primary and (2) secondary
- Get each possible build combination? (or just the most popular build for each primary and secondary?)
- Get stats like Damage, AoE, Rate of Fire, Ammo, Magazine
- Do a UMAP?
