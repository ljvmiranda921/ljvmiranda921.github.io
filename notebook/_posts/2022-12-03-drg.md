    I've already spent 600 hours in Deep Rock Galactic. With dozens of builds
    and loadouts, it's a game with endless variety and fun! In this blog post,
    I'll analyze different loadouts in Karl.GG, a popular website for sharing
    and discussing builds. Rock and stone!

<!-- what is DRG -->
<!-- motivation -->

## Getting the data


### A few caveats
<!-- a few caveats -->



## Analyzing the meta

<!--the best part about DRG is that you can play what you want to play-->
<!-- but what are the most discussed builds? -->


### What are the most popular builds?

<!-- popular builds per class -->
<!-- popular overclocks per primary -->
<!-- popularity vs. "quality" -->


### Scouts: how do you move?

<!-- with special poweder -->
<!-- without special poweder -->


### Drillers: Barbed drills or reinforced drills?

<!-- before and after Drilling in the name of video -->

### Gunners: Bigger shields or long-lasting shields?

### Engineers: When do you use Disabled Inertia Inhibitor?

## Analyzing Karl.GG

### How do build creators name their builds?

### What words do we often associate for each class?

### Build2Vec

<!--
- do this for (1) primary and (2) secondary
- Get each possible build combination? (or just the most popular build for each primary and secondary?)
- Get stats like Damage, AoE, Rate of Fire, Ammo, Magazine
- Do a UMAP?
