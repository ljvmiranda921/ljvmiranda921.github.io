   A review of the Jupyter Notebook ecosystem for 2020 
excerpt: "A review of the Jupyter Notebook ecosystem for 2020"

*Ah, Jupyter Notebooks.* Love it or hate it, they're here to stay.[^1] The last
time I wrote about them was two years ago (it's about [running a notebook
from a remote
server](https://ljvmiranda921.github.io/notebook/2018/01/31/running-a-jupyter-notebook/)),
and the ecosystem has grown ever since&mdash;even how I interact with notebooks
totally changed! 

**In this blog post, I'd review my oft-used tool in the data science toolbox,
Jupyter Notebooks.** First, I'll talk about the general data science climate for
the year 2020. Then, I'll zoom into the three main forces that changed the way
how I use Jupyter Notebooks today. Lastly, I'll conclude by writing a short
reflection and a lookahead of the Notebook ecosystem in the future.

To give context, a little more [about
me](https://ljvmiranda921.github.io/about/): as a data scientist, I alternate
between doing analyses on notebooks and writing production code for data
products. My work environment is highly-collaborative so I don't just review
code, I also read (and attempt to reproduce) others' notebook analyses. With
that said, I have a strong bias to production code and software
best practices, yet I still use notebooks in my day-to-day.[^2]

## The forces of change

The field of data science has [changed for the past two
years](https://veekaybee.github.io/2019/02/13/data-science-is-different/).
We've now entered a time where ["sexiest job of the 21st
century"](https://hbr.org/2012/10/data-scientist-the-sexiest-job-of-the-21st-century)
and ["data is the new
oil"](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2017/05/06/the-worlds-most-valuable-resource-is-no-longer-oil-but-data)
have become old catchphrases and replaced by more realistic business problems
with grounded technical challenges. There has also been a shift into more
"engineering-type of work with the rise of [machine learning engineers and data
science software
developers](https://d2wahc834rj2un.cloudfront.net/Workera%20Report.pdf).
Lastly, machine learning has been heavily-democratized with the continuous
adoption of popular frameworks such as scikit-learn, Pytorch, and HuggingFace's
transformers among many others.

This sets the stage as the tools around us begin to evolve&mdash; including
Jupyter Notebooks. In the face of these shifts in usage and adoption,
I'd like to focus on **three major forces that drive how I use Jupyter
Notebooks today.**

### Demand for quicker turnaround time from analysis to production


<! -- Include tools like papermill, restart and run kernel -->

### Higher collaboration across data science and engineering teams

<! -- version control and git integration, docker for repro -->

### Increased adoption of the Cloud

<! -- managed notebooks to accommodate hardware requirements for analyses -->


## Conclusion


<! -- wishlist -->



### Footnotes


[^1]: Not necessarily Jupyter or the tool itself, but rather the *idea* of [literate programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming) and how we use them in our day-to-day data science work
[^2]: Rereading that sentence felt like it's a punchline to a joke haha! Adhering to software best practices and using Jupyter Notebooks aren't mutually exclusive!
