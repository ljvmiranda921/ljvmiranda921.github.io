   A review of the Jupyter Notebook ecosystem for 2020 
excerpt: "A review of the Jupyter Notebook ecosystem for 2020"

*Ah, Jupyter Notebooks.* Love it or hate it, they're here to stay.[^1] The last
time I wrote about Notebooks was two years ago (it's about [running a notebook
from a remote
server](https://ljvmiranda921.github.io/notebook/2018/01/31/running-a-jupyter-notebook/)),
and the ecosystem has grown ever since&mdash;even how I interact with notebooks
totally changed! 

This blog post is my 2020 review on the Notebook ecosystem. More specifically, I'll
talk about:
- The three forces that's changing how we will use notebooks
- How I use Notebooks nowadays
- Opportunities and potential workflows

To give context, a little more [about
me](https://ljvmiranda921.github.io/about/): as a data scientist, I alternate
between doing analyses on notebooks and writing production code for data
products. My work environment is highly-collaborative so I don't just review
code, I also read (and attempt to reproduce) others' notebook analyses. With
that said, I have a strong bias to production code and software
best practices, yet I still use notebooks in my day-to-day.[^2]


## The three forces of change




### Footnotes


[^1]: Not necessarily Jupyter or the tool itself, but rather the *idea* of [literate programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming) and how we use them in our day-to-day data science work
[^2]: Rereading that sentence felt like it's a punchline to a joke haha! Adhering to software best practices and using Jupyter Notebooks aren't mutually exclusive!
