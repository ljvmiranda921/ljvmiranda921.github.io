*Ah, Jupyter Notebooks.* Love it or hate it, they're here to stay. The last
time I wrote about them was two years ago (it's about [running a notebook
from a remote
server](https://ljvmiranda921.github.io/notebook/2018/01/31/running-a-jupyter-notebook/)),
and the ecosystem has grown ever since&mdash;even how I interact with notebooks
totally changed! 

In this multi-part blogpost, I'd review my oft-used tool in the data science
toolbox, Jupyter Notebooks, and how I use them in modern times. I divided
this post into three:

* **Part I: The data science landscape** *(This page)*. I'd like to look into how the
    practice of data science has changed for the past few years. Then, I'll
    zoom into the three main forces that changed the way I use Notebooks today.
* [**Part II: How I use Notebooks in 2020**](/notebook/2020/03/16/jupyter-notebooks-in-2020-part-2/). Given these
    changes, new tools in the Notebook ecosystem emerged. I'd like to share
    what I like (and don't like) about them, and how I use them in my
    day-to-day.
* [**Part III: Notebooks and the future**](/notebook/2020/03/30/jupyter-notebooks-in-2020-part-3/). Here I'll share my
    wishlist for Notebooks, potential gaps that the community can still
    fill-in, and why Notebooks are still awesome! 

To give context, a little more [about
me](https://ljvmiranda921.github.io/about/): as a data scientist, I alternate
between doing analyses on notebooks and writing production code for data
products. My work environment is highly-collaborative so I don't just review
code, I also read (and attempt to reproduce) others' notebook analyses. With
that said, I have a strong bias to production code and software
best practices, yet I still use notebooks in my day-to-day.

## The data science landscape today

The field of data science is [rapidly changing
](https://veekaybee.github.io/2019/02/13/data-science-is-different/).  We've
now entered a time where phrases like ["sexiest job of the 21st
century"](https://hbr.org/2012/10/data-scientist-the-sexiest-job-of-the-21st-century)
and ["data is the new
oil"](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2017/05/06/the-worlds-most-valuable-resource-is-no-longer-oil-but-data)
have become old and replaced by more realistic business problems and grounded
technical challenges. I see this change as two-fold: we now need to support
both the (1) demand for productionizing analyses and experiments, and the (2)
rapid adoption of the Cloud.

the data science process for the past years

First, **the need for production**, i.e., creation of data products or
deploying experiment artifacts within the software engineering lifecycle, has
grown through the years. This is evidenced by an uptake for more
engineering type of work with the rise of [machine learning engineers and data
science software
developers](https://d2wahc834rj2un.cloudfront.net/Workera%20Report.pdf).
Furthermore, analyses aren't confined anymore inside
publications or charts, for there is now a growing demand for experiments to be
reproduced and its artifacts to be deployed.

Next, the exponential increase of data necessitates the
**adoption of the Cloud**.  We cannot just load a 1TB dataset in pandas using
our own laptops! The popularity of tools like Docker and Kubernetes
allowed us to scale our data-processing workloads at unprecedented levels.
Cloud adoption means that we take care of scaling, resource provisioning, and
infrastructure when managing our workloads. However, the previous Jupyter
Notebook ecosystem, as much as it is a staple in the data scientist toolbox,
isn't meant for these changes:

**Figure**: The Notebooks we know only cover a small domain of the data science
ecosystem
{: style="text-align: center;"}

As I've said, the Jupyter Notebook we've come to know isn't meant for these changes. 
They're meant for exploration, not production. They're meant to run in a single
machine, not a fleet of pods. However, for the past five years, the Jupyter
Notebook ecosystem has grown: we now have JupyterLab, several plugins, new kernels
for other languages, and third-party tooling available at our disposal. Sure,
we can still run notebooks by typing `jupyter notebook` in our terminals, but
it's now more than that! 

This then begs the question: *what are the forces
that prompted these changes?*, and *how can we leverage this larger notebook
ecosystem to respond to the changes in data science today?* 

## The three forces of change

The Jupyter Notebook ecosystem is growing, and I posit that this is driven by
three forces:
* **Experiment on the Cloud**: big data demands large compute and storage,
    something that your average consumer-grade machine will not always be
    capable of.
* **Support for developer workflow**: more and more data science teams are
    starting to adopt software engineering best
    practices&mdash;version-control, gitfow, pull requests, and more.
* **Quick turnaround from analysis to production**: it's not enough to test
    hypotheses under controlled environments. Software written for analysis
    should be easily reused for prod.

**Figure**: The growth of the Notebook ecosystem is driven by these forces
{: style="text-align: center;"}

Growing towards a more Cloud-first environment means that we can perform
Notebook-based tasks in machines more powerful than our own. For example,
managed notebook instances enabled us to run Jupyter notebooks from a remote
server with no-ops and setup. On the other hand, growing towards a more
Production workflow provides us with a set of tools to endow our notebook-based
tasks with software engineering practices. We'll see more of these tools in the
next part of this post.

Finally, note that the growth of a tool doesn't depend on a single entity or
organization. As we will see later on, filling these gaps may stem from
individuals who contribute third-party plugins or organizations offering managed
services from notebooks.

## Conclusion

In the first part of this series, we looked into the two drivers of growth in
the data science landscape: the (1) adoption of the Cloud, and the (2)
increasing demand for production. We saw that Jupyter Notebooks only fill a
small part of this ecosystem, i.e., it's often used for exploration (not
production) and only ran in our local machines (not in the Cloud). 

Then, using that same framework, we identified three forces of change that
allowed the Jupyter Notebook ecosystem to grow: increased experimentation on
the Cloud, support for developer workflow, and quicker turnaround from analysis
to production. These forces may have brought in the development of new tools,
plugins, and Notebook-like products to satisfy such gaps. 

For the [next part of this series](/notebook/2020/03/16/jupyter-notebooks-in-2020-part-2/), I'll talk about how we can use Jupyter
Notebooks given these forces of change. I'll review some of the tools and
workflows that have helped me in my day-to-day work and side-projects.
