<a span class="firstcharacter">L</a>ast month, I went through Peter Shirley's
"[Ray Tracing in One
Weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html)" to
build my very own ray tracer from scratch! I've been reading a lot about
computer graphics recently, and this guide encouraged me to try something on my
own. 

The book was easy to follow, and the math itself isn't complicated&mdash;just a
decent understanding of geometry (vectors, surface normals, Snell's law, etc.).
The code was written in C++, but I opted to write it in
[Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) as a learning practice. The best
part is that you get a nice output in the end:
