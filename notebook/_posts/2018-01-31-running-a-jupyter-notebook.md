In my research, I usually work with remote servers to run deep learning
models inside machines more powerful than my laptop. In some cases, I find
myself needing to fire up a Jupyter notebook to draw quick-and-easy
visualizations and short analyses. Here, I'll show you how to run a Jupyter
notebook from a remote server.

The main idea is that you will run a "headless" notebook from your server,
but have the graphical interface (GUI) show up in your local machine's web
browser. The libraries, hardware, and all backend-related stuff depends on
your remote machine, but the GUI is seen from your laptop.

**Set-up:** Here, let's define the local user and host as `localuser` and `localhost`
respectively. Similarly, let's define the remote user and remote host as
`remoteuser` and `remotehost`. Needless to say, make sure that [Jupyter notebook
and all its dependencies](http://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html)
are installed in both machines. Here's a quick diagram of the whole process, I
will discuss them one-by-one in the next section:

### Step 1: Run Jupyter Notebook from remote machine

Log-in to your remote machine the usual way you do. In most cases, this is simply
done via an `ssh` command. Once the console shows, type the following:

```s
remoteuser@remotehost: jupyter notebook --no-browser --port=XXXX

# Note: Change XXXX to the port of your choice. Usually, the default is 8888. 
# You can try 8889 or 8890 as well.
```

- `jupyter notebook`: simply fires up your notebook
- `--no-browser`: this starts the notebook without opening a browser
- `--port=XXXX`: this sets the port for starting your notebook where the default is `8888`. When it's occupied, it finds the next available port.

### Step 2: Forward port XXXX to YYYY and listen to it

In your remote, the notebook is now running at the port `XXXX` that you
specified. What you'll do next is forward this to port `YYYY` *of your
machine* so that you can listen and run it from your browser. To achieve
this, we write the following command:

```s
localuser@localhost: ssh -N -f -L localhost:YYYY:localhost:XXXX remoteuser@remotehost
```

- `ssh`: your handy ssh command. See [man page](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh) for more info
- `-N`: suppresses the execution of a remote command. Pretty much used in port forwarding.
- `-f`: this requests the `ssh` command to go to background before execution.
- `-L`: this argument requires an input in the form of `local_socket:remote_socket`. Here, we're specifying our port as `YYYY` which will be binded to the port `XXXX` from your remote connection.

### Step 3: Fire-up Jupyter Notebook

To open up the Jupyter notebook from your remote machine, simply start your
browser and type the following in your address bar:

```s
localhost:YYYY
```

Again, the reason why we're opening it at `YYYY` and not at `XXXX` is because
the latter is already being forwarded to the former. `XXXX` and `YYYY` can be
the "same" number (not the same port, technically) because they are from
different machines.

If you're successful, you should see the typical Jupyter Notebook home screen
in the directory where you ran the command in Step 1. At the same time, if
you look in your remote terminal, you should see some log actions happening
as you perform some tasks.

In your first connection, you may be prompted to enter an Access Token as typical
to most Jupyter notebooks. Normally, I'd just copy-paste it from my terminal, but
to make things easier for you, you can [set-up your own notebook password](http://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/public_server.html#automatic-password-setup).

### Closing all connections

To close connections, I usually stop my notebook from remote via `CTRL + C` then
`Y`, and kill the process on `YYYY` via:

```s
localuser@localhost: sudo netstat -lpn |grep :YYYY

# This will show the process ID (PID), e.g. ABCDEF of the one running in YYYY,
# you can kill it by simply typing

localuser@localhost: kill ABCDEF
```

## Making life easy

Because I often perform these commands in my daily work, I simply created
some functions where I only need to supply the port during connection. In my
configuration file (this can be your `.bashrc`), I have the following
commands:

**Helper function to fire-up a Jupyter notebook in remote**

```shell
function jpt(){
    # Fires-up a Jupyter notebook by supplying a specific port
    jupyter notebook --no-browser --port=$1
}
```

And thus I only need to write:

```shell
remoteuser@remotehost: jpt 8889
```

**Helper function to listen to a port**

```shell
function jptt(){
    # Forwards port $1 into port $2 and listens to it
    ssh -N -f -L localhost:$2:localhost:$1 remoteuser@remotehost
}
```

And so:

```shell
localuser@localhost: jptt 8889 8888
```

For me, this reads as "jupyter tunnel", and the whole command is like an
action "tunnel 8889 (the port from my remote) to 8888 (port from my local
machine)".

And that's basically it! The Jupyter notebook is really a wonderful tool for
literal programming where you can intersperse text and code in one document.
In my use-case, I don't have the Tensorflow GPU library in my local machine
so I need to run notebooks on-top of our laboratory's server. This enabled me
to decrease development time, and helped me perform fast analyses of my
models.
