## Introduction

<p><span class="firstcharacter">R</span>ecently I've been learning game development in Godot, and one my early
barriers is understanding the idea behind Nodes and Scenes. What helped me get
past this initial hump is by comparing it to an activity that I usually do:
cooking!</p>

Cooking for me is about **organizing ingredients into a more
complex form.** Put cooked rice, garlic, and butter in a pan, and you have
yourself a nice breakfast *sinang&aacute;g* (fried rice). You can compose and reuse ingredients&mdash; much like programming.

In this blogpost, I'll attempt to **explain the concept of Nodes and Scenes by
comparing it to the activity of cooking.** Specifically, I'll focus more on the
aspects of (1) composability and (2) reusability. Although it has [been touched
upon](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/getting_started/step_by_step/scenes_and_nodes.html)
by the official documentation, I think that there's still a lot that can be
unpacked from it. Because I'm in a pasta craze right now, I'll use *Chicken
Pesto Pasta*, one of my favorite dishes, as an example!

## Cooking employs composability

As a programmer, I relish the fact that cooking is hierarchical in nature.  I
can make an intricate dish by assembling basic ingredients together. For
example, to make pesto sauce, I group basil leaves, salt & pepper, and
butter in a pan (non-exhaustive list)[^1]:

<!-- stylized image of these ingredients in a square box -->
<!-- forms a stylized image of pesto sauce above it -->
![](/assets/png/godot-cooking/Blog_PestoSauc.png){:width="640px"}  
{: style="text-align: center;"}

The same goes for cooked pasta and chicken-cuts:

![](/assets/png/godot-cooking/Blog_ChxPasta.png){:width="640px"}  
{: style="text-align: center;"}

So, the process of making chicken pesto can be thought of as **iteratively
combining one ingredient over the other**. We start with *primary* ingredients
(salt, paper, basil leaves, etc.) to make relatively *complex* ones (pesto sauce,
chicken-cuts, pasta). Then, we arrange the latter for the final dish:

<!-- the picture of the hierarchy -->
![](/assets/png/godot-cooking/Mockup.png){:width="640px"}  
{: style="text-align: center;"}


**Composability** is one of the core principles of Nodes and Scenes in Godot. Nodes can
be thought of as the basic ingredients to build Scenes, a more complex
ingredient particular to your dish. In our cooking example above, the pesto
sauce, boiled pasta, and chicken-cuts&mdash;by nature of them being created
from basic ingredients (nodes)&mdash;can be considered as our Scenes.

<p style="border:3px; border-style:solid; border-color:#FF0000; padding: 1em;">
<b>A word of caution</b><br>
Contrary to the statement above, grouping nodes in a hierarchy doesn't
necessarily result into a Scene. Depending on your use-case, a hierarchy of
nodes can also be another Node! <i>To be more pedantic about it, Nodes can also
have children.</i> This also threw me off when I was starting out ("so what makes
them different?"), but <i>bear with my analogy for now</i>. As you'll see later
on, Scenes offer alot more than just hierarchy.</p>

If we extend our analogy further, then **Godot is a fully-stocked and
fully-equipped Kitchen at our disposal.** Enter the Kitchen and you'll find
almost any ingredient you can imagine: basil leaves, truffles, tuna, and more!
Similarly, in a gamedev sense, you'll find Nodes for [animating
sprites](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_animatedsprite.html),
[creating
maps](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/3.0/classes/class_tilemap.html),
[displaying
text](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_label.html), and
[more](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/index.html)!

> Godot is a fully-stocked and fully-equipped Kitchen at our disposal.

Now, let's cook a 2D-platformer level. I'll attempt to reconstruct a particular
level from one of my favorite games, Celeste, from the Nodes found in Godot.

As usual, we take  our basic ingredients (Nodes) from our kitchen (Godot) and
organize them into groups (Scenes): 
* For my Character, I'd mix an
[AnimatedSprite](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_animatedsprite.html),
[KinematicBody2D](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_kinematicbody2d.html),
and a
[Camera2D](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_camera2d.html).
* For my Map, I'll use a
[TileMap](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/3.0/classes/class_tilemap.html).
* And for my Collectibles , I'll have a
[Sprite](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_sprite.html)
and a
[RigidBody2D](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/latest/classes/class_rigidbody2d.html#class-rigidbody2d)
together

The list is by no means exhaustive. By combining the three together, we now have a Level![^2]
We can then make more of these Levels, combine them with one another, and build a game!

<!-- the picture of the hierarchy -->

{: style="text-align: center;"}

This level of expressiveness makes Godot's Node and Scene system powerful. We
start from "low-level" primitives (Nodes), and assemble them to create custom
objects for our use (Scenes). 

However, note that we can also express hierarchy by only using Nodes in a single
Scene. I often find this similar to mixing everything inside a large pot when
cooking: you can still make it work, but you need to be careful with your
process. Same with Godot, putting everything into a single Scene may require
you to rely upon your scripts and functions to achieve better encapsulation.

Whether to use a single Scene pattern often depends on your use-case: for
smaller games, one Scene with multiple Nodes may be enough. Just like in
cooking, if you're just going to stir-fry vegetables, putting them in a single
pan is enough.

<!-- hierarchy stir-fried veggies -->

{: style="text-align: center;"}

*If we can also use Nodes for hierarchy, then what is the incentive for using
Scenes?* The answer is reusability. In the next section, I'll discuss how we
can use Scenes not just to group related nodes together, but also to reuse them
and instantiate them whenever needed.

## Cooking employs reusability

The best thing about pesto sauce and chicken-cuts is that I can use them for
any other dish. After making a batch in the morning, I can keep them in a
container, and store them in a fridge. If in the afternoon I start craving
for a Grilled Chicken Pesto Sandwich, then I just take them out again and
combine them with other ingredients (in this case, bread and cheese).

<!-- the picture of the hierarchy: chicken pesto sandwich -->
![](/assets/png/godot-cooking/Blog_Reusability.png){:width="640px"}  
{: style="text-align: center;"}

"Storing them in the fridge" and "taking them out again" is a key advantage
that Scenes have over Nodes. I refer to this as **reusability**.

First, you can save Scenes into a disk, then,
load them back again to instantiate whenever you need to. If
I want to make a chicken sandwich, I don't need to prepare the ingredients
again; instead, I can just reuse the chicken-cuts that I made earlier.

In the context of game development, we often see this pattern in Enemy mobs or
collectible Items. First we prepare a *template* of an Item, and instantiate
copies of it [just in the time](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/j/jit.asp)
we'll need them. In *Celeste*, the strawberry collectible appears in multiple
areas of the game. We can implement this by creating a Strawberry template, and
placing it on different areas of the map.

{: style="text-align: center;"}


<p style="border:3px; border-style:solid; border-color:#FF0000; padding: 1em;">
<b>A word of caution</b><br>
Of course, unlike our cooking example, we can virtually create infinite copies
of our Scene&mdash;only limited by our system memory. The batch of pesto sauce
that I created in the morning will run out, but the Scene I made in Godot can
be instanced as much as I want. I consider this as a limit of our cooking analogy. </p>


With this insight, we can now think of Godot as a [**Scene Tree
editor**](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/getting_started/step_by_step/scene_tree.html).
Even a hierarchy of Nodes still belongs to a scene, in this case, the Main Scene
(or root node) of our game. Godot is powerful enough that we can customize a
Scene's behaviour during its lifecycle&mdash;when entering, when active, or
when exiting the tree. 

This mental model has also affected how I think about my projects in Godot.
Before, I often start by asking myself, "what Nodes should I use for my game?";
treating Nodes as my frame of reference. Now, it's more about asking "what are
the main components of my Game?", where *components* can easily be translated
into Scenes. Since Scenes are reusable, I just need to "think" about these
components once.

> Since Scenes are reusable, I just need to "think" about [my game's] component
> once.

Just like cooking, I approach things from top to bottom. I start by decomposing
a dish into its main components, e.g. sauce, meat, carbs, then I figure out the
basic ingredients needed to create them. 

## Mother's cooking advice: start simple

So far, we've looked into how the concept of Nodes and Scenes resembles that of cooking:
* Nodes and Scenes are composable, you can combine basic ingredients (Nodes)
    together to form complex building blocks (Scenes) for your game.
* Scenes are reusable, I can just prepare an ingredient once, and
    instantiate every time I need it. There is no need for me to build a
    new Scene every time. 

We've also seen how Godot can be likened to a fully-equipped Kitchen.  There,
we can find almost any ingredient to create almost any dish we can dream of. It's
powerful and fully-featured!

However, from my experience, too many features can be a tad overwhelming&mdash;
it's difficult to figure out where to start. Sometimes, I find Godot to be too
flexible to a fault: there's no enforced structure[^3], and it's up to you whether
to use Nodes or Scenes. It can be a boon for experienced game developers, but a
bane for amateurs like me.

> Sometimes, I find Godot to be too flexible ot a fault

At this point, I always go back to a cooking advice that my mom gives: **start
simple**. 

My first few attempts at cooking were as easy as putting things in a boiling
pot (like [*sinigang*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinigang) or sour stew) or
marinating meat (like [*adobo*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobo)). There's
only one level of hierarchy required, and I don't need to any ingedients:
**low complexity with minimal reusability**.

> Start simple: there's
> only one level of hierarchy required, without the need of reusing any ingedients:
> low complexity with minimal reusability

I figure that this principle applies similarly in Godot. It is easier to start
with a single Scene, and just create Node hierarchies as you go along. By doing
this many times over, I start developing an intuitive sense whether I need to
convert a node tree into a Scene. Good thing, Godot makes it simple to do so:
just Right-click a Node in your viewer, and "Convert Branch into a Scene"

And indeed, from my three years of software engineering experience, it is
usually easier to move from simplicity to complexity than the other way around.
Start with simple concepts, then add layers of abstraction as you go. Just like
in cooking, just start by putting stuff into a pot, and later on you'll see
yourself preparing more complex dishes.

## Conclusion

In this blogpost, I compared the concept of the Node-Scene system in Godot to the
activity of cooking. From what we've seen, both exhibit:
* **Composability**, similar to combining ingredients together to form a complex
    dish, we also combine Nodes to form Scenes, and Scenes to build our Game; and&mdash;
* **Reusability**, similar to preparing a batch of ingredients early on and
    reusing them for different dishes, I can also prepare a Scene and
    instantiate it whenever needed.

I also mentioned that if the Node-Scene system is like cooking, then Godot is
like a fully-stocked Kitchen. We enter and find almost any ingredient we can
imagine, from animating sprites to simulating 3d physical objects. It's a
well-supplied Kitchen at our disposal.

This then brought us to our final point: start simple. Navigating a large
Kitchen can be overwhelming, so just like what my mother said, it's OK to start
by putting things in a boiling pot. Start simple, and add complexity whenever
necessary.

I hope that you've learned something from this simple analogy. I find similar
joy in cooking and making games: sometimes I do them for myself, sometimes I do
them for others. There's a similar anticipation in asking, *"So, what do you
think?"*, after someone tasted a dish or play-tested a game. To be honest, I'm
still not ahead in my game-dev and cooking journey, so there's still a lot to
learn&mdash; exciting!
