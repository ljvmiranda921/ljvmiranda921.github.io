    Some updates on the calamanCy project and the Tagalog NLP pipeline. The tl;dr: we just finished
    re-annotating the dataset. I also want to share some thoughts on my learnings during the annotation process.

<span class="firstcharacter">F</span>irst off, I'm happy to see such warm
reception to my [first blog post](/2023/02/04/tagalog-pipeline/). Thank you!
There are a few more experiments that I wanted to do for the sake of
completeness and rigor. I hope to release the alpha version of
[calamanCy](https://github.com/ljvmiranda921/calamanCy) in August, so this blog
post may as well be a lead-up to that release. 

This blog post can be summarized as: "young and naive researcher just learned
something very obvious!" I am mostly referring to the annotation process.
Luckily, I was able to find two more folks to help with data annotation, and
we've been updating the original dataset for the past four months.

## Data annotation is not a waterfall process 

## Extra: hyperparameter optimization
