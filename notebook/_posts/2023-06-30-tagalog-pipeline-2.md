    Some updates on the calamanCy project and the Tagalog NLP pipeline. Tl;dr: we just finished
    re-annotating the dataset. I also want to share some thoughts on my learnings during the annotation process.

<span class="firstcharacter">F</span>irst off, I'm happy to see such warm
reception to my [first blog post](/2023/02/04/tagalog-pipeline/) about building
a Tagalog NLP pipeline. Thank you! There are a few more experiments that I
wanted to do for the sake of completeness and rigor. I hope to release the alpha
version of [calamanCy](https://github.com/ljvmiranda921/calamanCy) in August, so
this blog post may as well be a lead-up to that release. 

This blog post can be summarized as: "young and naive researcher just learned something very obvious!"



## On annotation

### How much change occured between silver to gold?

### Do I need to annotate more? 

## On building the pipeline

### What is the effect of hyperparameters? 

## On evaluation

### On which entities does the model make mistakes?

## Final thoughts
