  Last month, I had another guest lecture, this time in Dr. Charibeth Cheng's graduate class in DLSU! 
  Here, I talked about the craft of building small-scale yet effective NLP models for Filipino in the face of today's large language models.

<span class="firstcharacter">I</span> was invited to give a talk to a graduate-level NLP class about my work on Filipino resources.
It was fun preparing and giving that talk because I was able to synthesize my thoughts and look back on my previous research.
This blog post is my lecture in text format. 
**You can find the slides in this [link](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/10wrKZoBouh3agrgkTLjvJN9g9WwqdrjiwWSSztoyWdA/edit?usp=sharing).**
Finally, thank you to [Dr. Charibeth Cheng](https://www.dlsu.edu.ph/colleges/ccs/faculty-profile/cheng-charibeth/) for the invitation!
