    Using the text-to-image CLIP VQGAN neural network to generate surreal
    mythical creatures from Philippine folk culture.
---

Most of what we know from Philippine folklore came from stories passed down
from one generation to the next. We know that a *kapre* smokes a cigar, lives
in a tree, and has a large stature because "the auntie of our mother's friend"
said so. Words turn into images, bringing these creatures into life.

I wonder what will happen if we let AI do the same. **If we provide a
machine learning model with words and descriptions of folk creatures, what
images can it conjure?** 

To do so, I played with a neural network called CLIP-VQGAN ([Esser et al,
2021](#esser2021clip)) and supplied it with descriptions from Philippine folk
culture. The resulting images can then be thought of as to what
the model "imagined" upon reading the descriptions&mdash;I warn you, they are a
bit surreal and creepy!

## Monsters from the machine

Below you'll see AI generated creatures from text. The descriptions were lifted
from [*The Aswang Project*](https://www.aswangproject.com/) and Wikipedia. On
the left you'll see a clip of the model generating the image, and on the right
you'll see the final output. Also I kinda suck at CSS so this layout works best
on desktop!

### 1. Nunò sa punso

> Generally described as old men with flowing beards. They stand as tall as a
> three-year old child. In some stories, they wear a salakot, a traditional
> wide-brimmed hat made of rattan or reeds. They usually reside in an anthill
> or termite mound, hence the name.

### 2. Tiktik

> It looks like a large, man-sized vulture or raven. It has an unusual ability
> to fly low and slow, without the winds visibly flapping. Its defining feature
> is its highly prehensile tongue/proboscis that reportedly has the looks and
> dexterity of a human hand.

### 3. Kapre

> A tree giant, phenomenally tall, long-legged, god type of hairy humanoid that
> sits in big trees and smokes cigarattes. It is often seen waiting for people
> as they walk through a path. If you're stuck in a place and you keep going
> around in circles, you're said to be played around by a kapre.

### 4. Tikbalang

> A half-human, half-horse creature in the mold of the Greek Pan. It has
> unusually long, powerful legs that resemble the rear quarter of a horse, hooves
> and all. It does not hurt or kill people. At worst, it leads them astray and
> plays mischievous tricks on their senses.

### 5. Manananggal

>  An old mythical creature in the Philippines that separates from their lower
>  part of body and their fangs and wings give it a vampire-like appearance. It
>  is said to favor preying on sleeping, pregnant women, using an elongated
>  proboscis-like tongue to suck the hearts of fetuses, or the blood of someone
>  who is sleeping.

### 6. Mantiw

> Thirty foot, docile spirits in Iloilo that are often spotted in fields while leaning
> against coconut and buri palm trees. They have a fair complexion, broad
> shoulders, and hooked noses. They are reserved and peaceful, but are easily
> offended when a human attempts to whistle along them.

### 7. Tiyanak

>  A vampiric creature that takes on the form of a toddler or baby. Although
>  there are various types, it typically takes the form of a newborn baby and
>  cries in the jungle to attract unwary travelers. Once it is picked up by an
>  unfortunate passerby, it reverts to its true form and attacks the victim.

### 8. Sigbin

> It resembles a large dog or a hornless goat, but has large ears which it can
> clap like a pair of hands and a long, flexible tail that can be used as a
> whip. Families known as *Sigbinan* are said to keep the Sigbin in jars made of
> clay.

### 9. Santelmo

> A shortened form of St Elmo's Fire, it appears as a ball of fire and has
> served as an omen of heavenly intervention to sailors. It is found in fields
> and swamps and may have been caused by a spirit of a man who died near that
> area during heavy rain.

### 10. Bakunawa

> earthquakes, rains, and wind. In mythology, it is said that the Bakunawa
> would rise from the ocean and swallow the moon, causing an eclipse.

## Postscript

<!--
Aside from the upcoming Halloween season, this post was inspired by my recent
trip to my mother's province, [Iloilo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iloilo),
where I spent a few days during my sabbatical. As some of you may already know,
[Western Visayas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Visayas) is a place
teeming with Philippine folklore and myth. I learned a lot about supernatural
entities and my family history too *(oooh)*. I find it fun to put an AI spin to the
supernatural!
-->

As for the output, the surreal imagery added a nice touch&mdash; it gave our
mythical creatures an unearthly and bizarre vibe. I find the *nunò* and *kapre* 
surprising. They both capture what I imagine when I was young.

### Implementation details

I didn't write any code nor train any model to generate these images. Instead,
I used the [Google Colab
Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1_4Jl0a7WIJeqy5LTjPJfZOwMZopG5C-W?usp=sharing#scrollTo=g7EDme5RYCrt)
provided by [Katherine Crowson](https://github.com/crowsonkb)&mdash; all
credits go to her. I simply provided it with the text prompt, and have the
model generate the images for me. Open science is cool!

However, I did a few tweaks in the prompt to influence the results. For
example, I added tags like `artstation`, `blender` or `hdr` so that it shows
more artistic renders rather than watercolored images. Lastly, I also limited
the number of iterations to 1500, I noticed that most images converge around
this point. When using a GPU, it takes around ten minutes to generate a decent
image. 

**You can definitely create scary monsters by your own**, the [Colab
Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1_4Jl0a7WIJeqy5LTjPJfZOwMZopG5C-W?usp=sharing#scrollTo=g7EDme5RYCrt)
provides all the resources you need. You might also want to read the
[instructions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Lu7XPRKlNhBQjcKr8k8qRzUzbBW7kzxb5Vu72GMRn2E/edit?usp=sharing)
first before diving right in! For more inspiration, check out the
