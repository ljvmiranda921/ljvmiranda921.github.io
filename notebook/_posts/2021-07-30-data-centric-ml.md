<a id="introduction"></a><span class="firstcharacter">A</span> few months ago,
Andrew Ng [launched his campaign](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06-AZXmwHjo)
for a more data-centric approach to machine learning. This meant having to move
away from fiddling models to ensuring quality data across all. In line with
this, he also started the [Data-Centric AI
competition](https://https-deeplearning-ai.github.io/data-centric-comp/),
encouraging participants to increase accuracy by improving the dataset while
keeping the model fixed.

Going into this direction is promising, as **recent trends in the space
encourage a data-centric approach:**

* **We're discovering pitfalls for being too fixated on models**: achieving
    state-of-the-art (SOTA) with a model-centric approach incentivizes
    inane practices such as fixing random seeds and selective reporting
    ([Henderson et al, 2019](#henderson2019deeprl) and [Lipton et al,
    2019](#lipton2019trends)). Model results don't often lead to understanding,
    as researchers treat accuracy as a score to be won, and even admit to
    practice HARK-ing ([Bell et al, 2021](#bell2021psych) and [Sculley et al,
    2018](#sculley2019winner)).[^1] Inasmuch as researchers should correct
    these, perhaps a different problem-solving paradigm can also help.

* **Deep learning models are being democratized**: hyperoptimizing models
    become less necessary due to the SOTA being more accessible. In NLP, the
    open-source community led by [Huggingface](https://huggingface.co/) and
    [spaCy](https://spacy.io/) democratized Transformer models ([Vaswani,
    2017](#vaswani2017attention)) to the public. In the private space, OpenAI
    has [started offering access](https://openai.com/blog/openai-api/) to their
    GPT-3 ([Brown et al, 2020](#brown2020gpt3)) APIs, while cloud platforms
    like Google has made [AutoML available](https://cloud.google.com/automl).
    Model-wise, it has become easier to be successful by just switching models
    or using a paid API.

* **ML is catching-up on software engineering practices**: for the past year,
    we've seen the [rapid growth of software
    tooling](/notebook/2021/05/10/navigating-the-mlops-landscape/) in the
    machine learning space. Dubbed as MLOps, software engineering and DevOps
    practices are being set up to support the ML lifecycle&mdash; we're slowly
    paying off our technical debt ([Sculley, et al, 2015](#sculley2015debt)).
    Albeit a nascent field, we've already seen tools geared towards
    data-versioning, "smart" labelling, and tracking.[^2] Data-centric machine
    learning is poised to take advantage of these developments.

In the industry, a data-centric approach is appealing. **Data tend to have a
longer lifespan and a larger impact surface area.** Aside from using them as
raw materials for training models, one can create other artifacts like dashboards or
visualizations to drive important decisions. With the advent of [open
data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_data), even just the act of storing
and curating it is valuable enough. On the other hand, models are often
susceptible to concept drift, and is only good on what it was built for
([Tsymbal, 2004](#tsymbal2004drift), [Žliobaitė, 2010](#zliobaite2010drift), and
[Sambasivan, 2021](#sambasivan2021data)).

*So what is the general strategy for data-centric machine learning?*

### <a id="optimizing"></a> Optimizing on what you have

Almost all data work, prior to modelling, revolves around two elements: (1) the
domain-expert and (2) their data[set]. It is possible that one exists without the
other, that's why it's important to **optimize on what you have.** If both exist,
then we can think of their relationship as *symbiotic*:

![](/assets/png/data-centric/domain_expert_data.png){:width="460px"}
{: style="text-align: center;"}

Domain experts collect data, and in turn, data inform the expert ([Gennatas,
2020](#gennatas2020expert)). Both are enriched in the process: more data is
provided, while the domain expert expands their knowledge of the field.[^3]
This virtuous cycle generates insights and decisions for the organization. 

From a modelling perspective, it is much better if the dataset is curated,
i.e., it's *labeled.* This means that meaningful information is attached to a
given set of attributes. It then becomes straightforward to feed it into a
machine learning model. In an ideal state, you have plenty of domain experts
and labeled data. But in reality, organizations lack one or the other:

* **Little to no domain experts**: it then becomes difficult to label
    everything with quality. In addition, one can fall into the trap of blindly
    applying ML techniques without the relevant insight and data quality
    assurance an expert can provide. 

* **Little to no labeled data**: this time, it's challenging to train supervised
    models if the use-case demands for it. Labelling datasets can also become
    tedious, with or without the presence of domain experts. However, ML has
    progressed enough to understand unsupervised data, so it's still possible
    to extract value on the given dataset.

We can visualize their interaction in the graph below, with the x-axis
representing the domain-expertise available for the problem, and the y-axis
representing the amount of unlabeled data available. I also went ahead and
plotted techniques that fall under each region:

![](/assets/png/data-centric/data_centric_framework.png){:width="640px"}  
__Figure:__ Putting data-centric machine learning into context.
{: style="text-align: center;"}

There's a lot of moving parts, so let me describe each region:

* **Region of supervised learning:** the number of unlabeled data is
    too low that it is straightforward to use a supervised learning approach. 
    Note that this is viable even with the presence or absence of a
    domain-expert. 

* **Region of unsupervised learning:** the number of unlabeled
    data is too high that supervised learning techniques will either fail to
    generalize or are unusable altogether. Common unsupervised techniques
    involve clustering and dimensionality reduction, among many others.

* **Expert systems region:** we still have a lot of unlabeled
    data, but we have access to domain-knowledge. Given that, creating
    rule-based expert systems may be better. Most process automation and
    document processing fall under this area. In addition, I also included
    theory-heavy, dynamic modelling approaches found in meteorology and
    financial engineering in this region.

* **Data-centric band _(our focus)_:** the problems encountered in this region 
   do not only involve the type of model to use, but also the quality of data
   at hand.  Here, you'll find techniques that attempt to increase the number
   of labeled data, take advantage of domain expertise in modelling, and
   improve the quality of existing datasets.

There is a common misconception that machine learning is a binary choice
between a supervised or unsupervised learning problem. Industrial machine
learning rarely makes this decision easy. Oftentimes, **machine learning
problems exist within the data-centric band**: datasets are messy, domain-experts
may not be available, and labeled data is hard to come by. 

In the next section, we'll go over the techniques presented in the data-centric
band. We'll first look into those that do not require the presence of a
domain-expert, then move towards more expert-driven approaches.  Note that
inasmuch as I want to be comprehensive in this review, I still limited the
number of represented techniques for brevity.

## <a id="q1"></a> Large unlabeled data, low domain-expertise

This may be the most common scenario in industrial machine learning: an
abundance of unlabeled data with few experts to be found. If they exist, then
the problem becomes about data collection and curation. We usually observe this
in radiology, especially in datasets involving ultrasound, magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI), and X-ray ([Masqood et al, 2019](#masqood2019alzheimer), [Shin
et al, 2016](#shin2016computer) and [Byra et al, 2019](#byra2019knee)). 

We also encounter this problem in standard computer vision (CV) and natural
language processing (NLP) tasks, moreso if the dataset isn't similar to any of
the benchmark ones.


![](/assets/png/data-centric/framework_left.png){:width="640px"}  
{: style="text-align: center;"}

First, we'll look into three model-based approaches: transfer learning,
multi-task learning, and semi-supervised learning. All **relax the dependency
on labeled data by taking advantage of existing or solved tasks.** In addition,
we also have crowd-sourced labelling that aims to **increase the amount of
labeled data.**

* **Transfer learning:** involves the transfer of knowledge across domains or tasks. 
     It challenges the common assumption that both training and test data
     should be drawn from the same distribution ([Zhuang et al,
     2020](#zhuang2020survey)).  Knowledge transfer can be in the form of
     instances, feature representations, model parameters, or relational
     knowledge ([Pan and Yang, 2009](#pan2009survey)).

     A common use-case involves adopting an architecture like AlexNet
     ([Krizhevsky et al, 2012](#krizhevsky2012alexnet)), pretrainng it on
     ImageNet ([Deng et al, 2009](#deng2009imagenet)), and replacing the last
     fully connected layers with new ones from the target domain. The modified
     architecture is then finetuned on target domain labels for classification.

* **Multi-task learning (MTL):** involves learning two or more related tasks
    simultaneously ([Ruder, 2017b](#ruder2017mtl), [Zhuang et al,
    2020](#zhuang2020survey) and [Crawshaw, 2020](#crawshaw2020mtl)). Its goal
    is to "improve generalization by leveraging domain-specific information
    found in the training signals of related tasks ([Caruana,
    1997](#caruana1997mtl))." MTL works because it forces models to regularize
    via (implicit) data augmentation, focusing attention, eavesdropping, and
    adding representation bias ([Ruder, 2017b](#ruder2017mtl)).

    There are two common setups for multi-task learning for deep neural
    networks: *hard* and *soft* parameter sharing. The former shares hidden
    layers across tasks where each task has its own output layer, while the
    latter constrains them using a cost function ([Duong et al,
    2015](#duong2015soft) and [Yang and Hospedales, 2017](#yang2016soft)).

* **Semi-supervised learning (SSL):** is a combination of both supervised and
    unsupervised learning techniques. It takes advantage of the information
    found in the labels or cluster to improve performance ([Zhu,
    2005](#zhu2005semisupervised)).  For a supervised classification task, we
    use the implicit cluster information found from unlabeled data. For
    unsupervised classification, we harness the existing label-information
    found in the dataset ([Van Engelen and Hoos, 2020](#vanengelen2020survey)).

    SSL requires that the distribution of the input contains some information
    about its output ([Van Engelen and Hoos, 2020](#vanengelen2020survey)).
    Moreover, it also assumes the following in our data ([Chapelle, et al,
    2006](#chapelle2006semisupervised)): neighboring points likely belong to
    the same class *(smoothness)*, a decision boundary passes through regions
    with low-density *(low-density)*, and that the input-space is composed of
    low-dimensional substructures *(manifolds)*.

* **Crowd-sourced labelling:** this approach doesn't necessarily solve the data
    problem as-is. Instead, it moves us to a different position in the matrix,
    where a more straightforward solution like *supervised learning* can be
    applied. By tapping onto a large group, it is possible to obtain decent
    amounts of labeled data ([Raykar et al, 2019](#raykar2019crowds)). For
    example, [Giuffrida, et al (2018)](#giuffrida2018plant) used a combination
    of citizen crowds and experts to classify a plant's phenotype based on its
    image.

    However, there is a tendency for a dataset (and consequently, the model) to
    be "polluted" due to the high variability of annotators ([Della Penna and
    Reid, 2012](#dellapenna2012crowd) and [Kajino, 2012](#kajino2012crowd)).
    Thus, a labeling setup should be handled with as much care as possible.
    Common tools for crowd labelling involve cloud platforms such as [AWS
    Mechanical Turk](https://www.mturk.com/) and [Google's Data Labeling
    Service](https://cloud.google.com/ai-platform/data-labeling/docs). 


## <a id="q1"></a> Large unlabeled data, high domain-expertise

This section involves techniques that rely heavily on an expert's domain
knowledge to solve the data problem. Domain knowledge is still invaluable, and
can find its use not only in model explainability ([Biran and Cotton,
2017](#biran2017expert) and [Doshi-Velez and Kim, 2017](#doshi2017expert)), but
also in the collection and preparation of data ([Yin et al,
2020](#yin2020expert)). 

An expert system is the outcome of extreme reliance to a domain expert. Unlike
machine learning, rules are meticulously handcrafted instead of learned
([Buchanan, 1989](#buchanan1989expert), [Weiss and Kulikowski,
1991](#weiss1991expert) and [Ben-David and Frank, 2009](#bendavid2009expert)).
This approach may not always be scalable, especially at the sight of new data.
However, because the rules are explicit, it is possible to justify and explain
the system's outcome.

![](/assets/png/data-centric/framework_right.png){:width="640px"}  
{: style="text-align: center;"}

Here, you'll see **how a domain expert can contribute to crucial parts of the
machine learning pipeline.** For example, *active learning* and *weak
supervision* tap domain knowledge to accurately and efficiently label relevant
samples in the dataset, *data augmentation* seeks to add meaningful variation
in the data to help create a robust model, and *data assimilation* aims to
combine expert knowledge and a data-driven approach to build more accurate
models.

* **Data assimilation (DA):** combines theory with observations ([Bouttier and
    Courtier, 2002](#bouttier2002da)). It is widely-used in meteorology and
    geosciences, particularly in weather prediction ([Law et al,
    2015](#law2015da) and [Ghil and Malanotte-Rizzoli, 1991](#ghil1991da)).
    Like machine learning, DA can also do forecasting, parameter optimization,
    and interpolation. However, the main difference is that DA utilizes a
    dynamic model of the system being analyzed. It combines data with
    mathematical models like
    [Lorenz96](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorenz_96_model) to describe
    phenomena. 

    Here, the domain-expert's contribution is to determine the dynamic model
    that best describes their system's behaviour. This may even be akin to
    "handcrafting the model."  However, not all problems have their equivalent
    model, putting favor to more data-driven approaches. Finally, there are
    efforts to combine machine learning and data assimilation ([Brajard et al,
    2020](#brajard2020da) and [Abarbanel et al, 2018](#abarbanel2018da)), and
    it will be interesting to follow their development.

* **Active learning:** attempts to overcome the label bottleneck by
    intelligently asking a domain-expert (also known as *oracle* in active
    learning literature) to label select instances that will increase accuracy
    ([Settles, 2009](#settles2009active)). The motivation is to have the
    learning algorithm choose the data from which it learns, thus lowering
    training costs ([Cohn et al, 1996](#cohn1996active) and [Settles,
    2009](#settles2009active)). This can be achieved by query-strategies such
    as uncertainty sampling ([Lewis and Gale, 1994](#lewis1994active)),
    query-by-committee ([Seung et al, 1992](#seung1992active)), and computing
    expected model change ([Settles et al, 2007](#settles2007active)). 

    In reality, it turns out that the presence of a domain-expert is not a
    cure-all for the data problem. [Settles (2011)](#settles2011active)
    highlighted some challenges when applying active learning in practice
    including lack of batch querying, noisy and unreliable oracles, and
    variable learning costs. Currently, examples of tools that endow active
    learning to their labelling workflow are [Prodigy](https://prodi.gy/),
    [SageMaker Ground Truth](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/groundtruth/),
    and
    [Dataiku](https://www.dataiku.com/product/plugins/ml-assisted-labeling/).

* **Weak supervision:** is a class of techniques where training data can be
    inexact, or innacurate ([Zhou, 2018](#zhou2018weak)). Inexact samples occur
    when only coarse-grained information is provided. For example, predicting
    if a new molecule can make a special drug is based on its specific
    configuration. However, domain experts only know if a molecule is
    "qualified" to produce one, not necessarily which shape is decisive
    ([Dietterich, 1997](#dietterich1997multi)). One can solve this by
    explicitly asking the expert to "program" the training data, that is,
    create training functions to encode their business rules ([Ratner et al,
    2016](#ratner2016dataprog) and [Ratner et al, 2017](#ratner2017snorkel)).
    This type of "data programming" has been prevalent recently, with the rise
    of open-source tools like
    [Snorkel](https://github.com/snorkel-team/snorkel). 


    As for inaccuracy, labeled samples are available but there's no guarantee
    that they're error-free. Even benchmark datasets like CIFAR-10 suffer from
    label inaccuracies ([Beyer et al, 2020](#beyer2020imagenet) and [Northcutt
    et al, 2021a](#northcutt2021error)). Due to that, a sub-field caleed
    *confident learning* was developed to detect and correct such errors
    ([Northcutt et al, 2021b](#northcutt2021confident)). Its main mechanism
    involves pruning noisy data and ranking examples to train with confidence
    ([Northcutt et al, 2017](#northcutt2017pruning)). Lastly, confident
    learning also exists as an open-source package,
    [cleanlab](https://github.com/cgnorthcutt/cleanlab).


## Conclusion

In this blogpost, we reviewed different techniques towards data-centric machine
learning. First, we looked into how recent trends motivate a different problem
solving paradigm, then we focused our attention to the interplay betweeen a
domain-expert and the dataset. 

We then presented a simple graph that attempts to put each approach into
context. We've seen techniques differ based on the presence of a domain-expert,
and the amount of unlabeled data in the dataset. Moreover, we also defined
regions based on traditionally known techniques: supervised learning, unsupervised
learning, and expert systems. 

Lastly, the middle region in our plot represents the
data-centric band, and we introduced what each technique does on a high level. 
We've seen methods that tap on the knowledge of domain experts, and techniques
that take advantage of solved tasks. All of which improve the data we have at
hand, leading to better models and high-quality data.

## Postscript

*Phew!* This is probably the longest blogpost I've written (if you can even
call it that). At first, I was inspired by the blogs of [Lilian
Weng](https://lilianweng.github.io/lil-log/) and [Sebastian
Ruder](https://ruder.io/), that I wanted to write a literature review of my
own. I may have overdone it, as it spans a huge breadth of techniques under a
large umbrella. Nevertheless, I'm happy with what I've written, and what you
see here is a big compilation of my study notes in this space.

As for the topic, data-centric machine learning and the techniques involved in
it piqued my curiosity. Insufficient samples, clerical errors, and unreliable
sources are just a few among many challenges seen in industrial machine learning.
Inasmuch as I wanted to approach it with tools and platforms that exist today, I
am also excited to endow an academic approach to it, hence the tone.

Researching this took me two full months, mostly working on evenings and
weekends. However, I had some practice writing *very* long-form content, as you
may have seen in "Navigating the MLOps Landscape" and "How to use Jupyter
Notebooks." I'd probably do this again in the future, but I'll definitely lower
my scope.

## Footnotes

[^1]: HARK-ing, refers to the research practice of hypothesizing after the results are known. Norbert Kerr defined it as "presenting a post hoc hypothesis in the introduction of a research report as if it were an a priori hypothesis"
[^2]: Examples of labelling tools: [Prodigy](https://prodi.gy/), [Snorkel](https://snorkel.ai/), [Label Studio](https://labelstud.io/). Examples of data-versioning and tracking (lineage) tools: [MLFlow](https://mlflow.org/), [DVC](https://dvc.org/), [Pachyderm](https://www.pachyderm.com/). 
[^3]: That's why I still think that ML practitioners who came from a non-ML field (psychologists, sociologists, economists, etc.) are at an advantage: they have an intimate knowledge of the field, and see ML as a tool.
[^4]: At first, I was tempted to think of the data-centric problem purely as a *weak supervision problem.* There are big overlaps between the two, and I'm not opposed to simply considering one as the other. To be honest, I still find the taxonomy confusing: [Zhou (2018)](#zhou2018weak) sees *active learning* and *semi-supervised learning* as sub-categories of *weak supervision*, whereas [Ratner et al (2019)](#ratner2019weak) sees them as separate. There are merits on both views, but I decided to separate them since there are other use-cases that *weak-supervision* doesn't cater to.
