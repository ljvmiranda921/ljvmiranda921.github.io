Today, I'm learning about *movement* in Pico-8 and other *optimizations to
improve game feel*. This includes the following:
* [**Basic sprite movement**](#basic-sprite-movement). How I move an 8x8 sprite
  on four directions from a button-press.
* [**Smoother tile transition**](#smoother-tile-transition). How to remove the
  jarring effect of moving from tile to tile.
* [**Input buffering**](#input-buffering). How to improve game feel so that
  button inputs are rendered properly.

These are my study notes while going through [LazyDev's roguelike
tutorial](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLea8cjCua_P3LL7J1Q9b6PJua0A-96uUS),
so be sure to check that one out! I'll try to post my code on Github and build
some minimal examples in the process. Lastly, these posts assume a basic
knowledge of Pico-8 (e.g., game loop, basic Lua, etc.), so I'll skip over some
parts.

## Game loop revisited


Pico-8's primary mechanism is defined by the [game
loop](https://pico-8.fandom.com/wiki/GameLoop). I see this to be akin to the
[model-view-controller (MVC) pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller) in software design (with the addition of
`_init()`)

![](/assets/png/pico8-move/MVC.gif){:width="320px"}  
{: style="text-align: center;"}


- **`_init()`** is called once. Sets up the data structures and initializes
    all variables.
- **`_update()`** is the Model. All compute, logic, and rules are defined
    here.
- **`_draw()`** is the View. Displays the information based from what was
    computed by the Model.

The Controller, in my opinion, is Pico-8's  standard library. It accepts
keyboard or controller input, and transforms them into something understandable
by the model.



### Pointers to functions

One pattern that I often see in Pico-8 code is the use of *function pointers*.
You can assign a function name to a variable, and call it in another line. For
example:

```lua
function move_entity()
    -- calls whatever function 
    -- is referenced into _mov
    _mov()
end

function move_player()
   if path_is_clear then
        _mov = move_normal
   elseif path_is_blocked then
        _mov = move_with_bump
   end
end
```

The `move_entity` function just calls a generic `_mov`, whatever its definition
will be. How `_mov` behaves is manipulated by the `move_player` function. Based
on which condition is true, `_mov` can be `move_normal` or `move_with_bump`.
Because the game-loop always calls `_update` for every tick, then the move
conditions are always checked.

This technique is often used on the built-in `_update()` and `_draw()`
functions. My guess is that it makes the game-loop functions much cleaner.
My worry is that it may be a bit harder to track what's happening, but perhaps
this technique lessens the tokens we'll write in the end. In this regard, our
game-loop will look like this:

```lua
function _init()
   -- all init functions 
   _upd=update_game
   _drw=draw_game
end

function _update()
    _upd()
end

function _draw()
    _drw()
end
```

The `_update` and `_draw` functions will repeatedly call whatever `_upd` and
`_drw` references to respectively. Later on, we can tell the program that
`_upd` must update the game environment (`_update_game`) or update the player
(`_update_pturn`). All this thanks to Lua's ability to pass functions as
pointers.

## Basic sprite movement

First, let's introduce our sprite character, Picollino! The imagery of
the word evokes a derpy tomato so we'll stick with that:

![](/assets/png/pico8-move/Picollino.gif){:width="200px"}  
{: style="text-align: center;"}

Picollino's movement will follow the style of an overworld adventure game
rather than a platformer. Thus, we don't need to factor in gravity or friction.
In an overworld grid, our character's position is defined by its
**tile-coordinates** $$x$$ and $$y$$. 

Token optimization aside, let's define a function that initializes a player:

```lua
-- initialize a player at game start
-- @return player table with init values
function make_player()
    local p = {
        -- initial coordinates
        x=32,
        y=32,
        -- animation attributes
        flip=false,
        anim={1,2,3,4}
    } 
    return p
end
```

Movement is now a matter of changing these $$x$$ and $$y$$ coordinates
in response to a button press. I learned that in Pico-8, this change is often
denoted by $$dx$$ and $$dy$$ for the $$x$$ and $$y$$ coordinates respectively.

Thus, moving right is just $$x \Leftarrow x + dx$$, and down is $$y \Leftarrow
y + dy$$ (yup it's positive going down). Going to the opposite direction is
achieved by inverting the signs.

I prefer writing a function, `move_player(dx, dy)`, that takes in the
corresponding change in position. Then, it updates the player coordinates with
the new values. Ideally, I'd like to add a `player` argument in this function
(a la `move_player(p, dx, dy)`), but it costs alot of tokens so we have to make
do with global variables.

```lua
-- move_player updates player coordinates
-- @param dx change in the x-axis 
-- @param dy change in the y-axis
function move_player(dx, dy)
    -- we multiply by 8 because 1 tile = 8 pixels
    -- moving a player on a single tile is actually a movement of 8 pixels
    local destx, desty = p.x + dx * 8, p.y + dy * 8
    p.x, p.y = destx, desty
end
```

For our button-press, I'd like to write two more functions. The first,
`update_game()`, will be called every time to check for button presses and/or
resolve variables and computations. The second, `exec_btn(b)`, takes in a
[button's numerical value](https://pico-8.fandom.com/wiki/Btn) and call the
handler function. Let's write the first one:

```lua
-- update_game checks for button-presses and perform calculations
function update_game()
    for i=0,5 do  -- btn(5) is X, for opening menu?
        if btnp(i) then
            exec_btn(i)
        end
    end
end
```

For the second one, instead of writing `if` statements for each directional
button, we can store $$dx$$ and $$dy$$ values in an array, and call them
whenever their respective [button-number](https://pico-8.fandom.com/wiki/Btn)
is called.

```lua
-- exec_btn handles button calls
-- @param b is the button number from pico8.fandom.com/wiki/Btn
function exec_btn(b)
    -- preload (L=0,R=1,U=2,D=3)
    local dirx = {-1,1,0,0}
    local diry = {0,0,-1,1}

    if b>=0 and b<4 then
        move_player(dirx[b+1], diry[b+1])
        return
    end
end
```

To explain `dirx` and `diry`, here's an example: moving left requires a
negative offset in the x-coordinate ($$x_2 = x_1 + dx$$ where $$dx=-1$$) while
$$y$$ stays the same ($$y_2=y_1+dy$$ where $$dy=0$$). Now, the left button
(<kbd>&larr;</kbd>) is numerically-assigned in Pico-8 as button `0`. Hence, in
the zeroth-index of `dirx` and `diry`, we have `-1` and `0`. Note that in Lua,
**arrays start at 1**, so we just add `1` when providing the index.

Awesome! With the functions above, we now have a rudimentary system for
movement. This works, but we just need to draw the sprite! In the `_draw()`
function, just call the [`spr()` function](https://pico-8.fandom.com/wiki/Spr):

```lua
-- draw_game is a handler for all drawing events
function draw_game()
    cls(0)
    map()
    spr(1, p.x, p.y, 1, 1, p.flip)
end
```

## Smoother tile transition

Picollino's movement still looks a bit jarring: he seems to "teleport" from one
tile to another. This is because we are moving 8 pixels right away, a large
distance in my opinion. I'll improve animation by doing the following:
1. Flip the sprite when moving to the opposite direction
2. Add a "smoother" to ease the transition from one tile to the next.
3. Sprite animation

### Flip sprite based on direction

The first one is easy. Recall that in our `make_player()` function, we have
a `flip` attribute. We set that as `true` when our sprite is moving to the left,
i.e. when `dx < 0`. We'll update the `move_player()` function to account for
this change.

```lua
-- move_player updates player coordinates
-- @param dx change in the x-axis 
-- @param dy change in the y-axis
function move_player(dx, dy)
    local destx, desty = p.x + dx * 8, p.y + dy * 8
    ------------------NEW CODE---------------------
    if dx < 0 then
        p.flip = true
    elseif dx > 0 then 
        p.flip = false
    end
    -----------------------------------------------
    p.x, p.y = destx, desty
end
```

We use `elseif` instead of `else` so that the sprite won't immediately
face `right` if our last action was `left` and we decide to move `up` or
`down`.

### Tile transition

In order to understand LazyDev's technique for smoother tile transition,  let
me  illustrate an example. Suppose we want to move a sprite to the right from
tile $$T(3,2)$$ to $$T(4,2)$$. In pixel coordinates, we are essentially
"teleporting" from $$P(24,16)$$ to $$P(32,16)$$, a huge distance that doesn't
look like walking. Instead, we want to traverse the $$x$$ axis in small
increments, i.e. $$24, 24.8, 25.6, 26.4, \ldots$$, until it reaches its
destination.

![](/assets/png/pico8-move/OffsetCompare.gif){:width="400px"}  
{: style="text-align: center;"}

We accomplish this by defining an offset that will incrementally move the
sprite from its old coordinate to the new one, i.e. $$P_{x_2,y_2} = P_{x_1,y_1} + o_{x,y}$$. The rate in which the offset updates is controlled by a new
variable, $$p_t$$, that dictates how fast the transition will be animated.

Because we want to save tokens, we precompute the destination and subtract the
offset as we go along. So in our earlier example, we will set $$P_{x,y}$$ to
its new value, $$P(32,16)$$, and perform subtraction when calling the `spr()`
function. 

The offset $$o_{x,y}$$ starts with a value $$s_{x,y}$$ and grows smaller as it
reaches $$0$$:

$$
o_{x,y} = s_{x,y} * (1 - p_t), s_{x,y} = -d_{x,y}
$$

where $$s_{x,y}$$ is the start value for the offset. The transition speed,
$$p_t$$ is then defined and updated as:

$$
p_t \Leftarrow min(p_t+\delta,1), p_0 = 0
$$

where $$\delta$$ controls how fast it can be. Notice that it is clipped to
$$1$$. To be honest, I find it a bit convoluted, but I think these are
optimizations to reduce token count, a very important resource in Pico-8. 

Below is a table of values so you can see the relationship between $$p_t$$, the
offset $$o_{x,y}$$, and what is actually drawn or sent to the `spr()` function.
Note that here, we're moving in pixel coordinates from $$P(24,16)$$ to
$$P(32,16)$$, with $$\delta=0.1$$ and $$s_x=-dx*8=-1*8=-8$$. I'll only list down
the values in the $$x$$-axis, because we only move in that direction:

| $$p_t$$, transition speed | 0.0    | 0.1      | 0.2      | 0.3      | 0.4      | 0.5    | 0.6      | ... | 1.0    |
|---------|--------|----------|----------|----------|----------|--------|----------|-----|--------|
| $$o_x$$, size of move-offset | -8     | -7.2     | -6.4     | -5.6     | -4.8     | -4.0   | -3.2     | ... | 0      |
| `spr()`, drawn on-screen | **24** | **24.8** | **25.6** | **26.4** | **27.2** | **28** | **28.8** | ... | **32** |


To accomplish this, we define a function, `update_pturn`, that signals the
start of a player turn. We time this turn by $$p_t$$, that increments by
$$\delta$$ until it reaches $$1$$. Once $$p_t=1$$, we remove control from the
player and update the game via `update_game`:

```lua
function update_pturn()
    delta=0.1
    p_t = min(p_t+delta, 1) -- increment timer
    if p_t == 1 then  -- if timer is done...
        -- ...end player turn and update game
        _upd=update_game
    end
end
```

Let's initialize `p_t` in our `_init` function. It starts from $$0$$ and it's
capped at $$1$$:

```lua
function _init()
    ------------------NEW CODE---------------------
    p = make_player()
    p_t=0
    -----------------------------------------------
    _upd=update_game
    _drw=draw_game
end
```

We move during a player's turn, so let's add in a generic function, `p_mov`.
Later on, we'll pass function pointers to `p_mov` so that we can control the
type of movement it will execute:

```lua
function update_pturn()
    delta=0.1
    p_t = min(p_t+delta, 1)
    ------------------NEW CODE---------------------
    p_mov()
    -----------------------------------------------
    if p_t == 1 then
        _upd=update_game
    end
end
```

We just need to update the `move_player` function so that all movement
initialization steps are defined here. Later on, we'll implement `mov_walk` to
define the incremental transition discussed in the table of values above:

```lua
function move_player(dx,dy)
    -- remove multiplier, move it to draw
    local destx, desty = p.x + dx, p.y + dy 
    if dx < 0 then
        p.flip = true
    elseif dx > 0 then 
        p.flip = false
    end

    ------------------NEW CODE---------------------
    -- move player by dx, dy [-1, 0, 1]
    p.x += dx  
    p.y += dy
    -- previous location after moving is just inverse
    p.sox, p.soy = -dx * 8, -dy * 8
    p.ox, p.oy = p.sox, p.soy
    p_t = 0
    -- update function pointers
    _upd = update_pturn  -- start player turn and...
    p_mov = mov_walk  -- ... move by walking
    -----------------------------------------------
end

```

Now, `mov_walk` performs the computation we had above. As `p_t` increases from
$$0\Rightarrow 1$$, the offsets `p.ox` and `p.oy` approach zero. We'll also
update our `draw_game` function to make use of our offsets:


```lua
function mov_walk()
    p.ox=p.sox * (1-p_t)
    p.oy=p.soy * (1-p_t)
end

function draw_game()
    cls(0)
    map()
    spr(1, p.x*8+p.ox, p.y*8+p.oy, 1, 1, p.flip)
    -- p.x, p.y are already in the new position (destination), but instead,
    -- we draw its offset
end
```

Again, `p.x` and `p.y` are already in their new positions after moving
(destination). However, we don't want to draw this position immediately. We
draw the new position plus offset that starts from `-8` (i.e., the previous
position) until it reaches `0` (i.e., the new/current position). Let's look at
the sprite movement, observe that it's much smoother now!

### Sprite animation

Let's just do a simple animation for Picollino:

![](/assets/png/pico8-move/AnimationSeq.png){:width="400px"}  
{: style="text-align: center;"}


In order for the program to cycle through these frames, we need to define a
"global" timer `t`. Based on the timer value, the frame number will change. 
We use a simple trick to cycle across frames in `p.anim`: by mod-dividing the value
of `t` by the length of our animation array, we can get all animation frames:

```lua
index = t%#ani + 1
```
So, even if we're far ahead of the animation timer (say, `t=2000+`), the index
of `p.anim` will still be within range. We can control the transition speed by
dividing `t` by some number. Let's modify the equation above and show a table
of values for illustration:

```lua
function get_frame(ani)
    rate=2 -- controls transition speed
    return ani[flr(t/rate)%#ani+1]
end
```

| t             | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 |
|---------------|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `t%#ani+1`    | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 1 |
| `get_frame()` | 1 | 1 | 2 | 2 | 3 | 3 | 4 | 4 | 1 |


## Input buffering

Notice how the sprite only registers your move once its turn is done. This
means that when you try to input two commands in a row, only one of them will
be executed. It's not good for *game feel*, thus, we can solve this
quality-of-life issue by buffering the inputs.

The way input-buffering works is that we have a "buffer" that stores whatever
key we pressed while the player turn (i.e., `update_pturn`) is still active. 
The input stored in this buffer is then executed once `update_game` is called.
Its basic form is:

```lua
if buffer==-1 then
        buffer=get_btn()
end
exec_btn(buffer) -- only called in update_game
```

We just need to update our `exec_btn` function to accommodate the case when
buffer is untouched (`buffer==-1`):

```lua
-- exec_btn handles button calls
-- @param b is the button number from pico8.fandom.com/wiki/Btn
function exec_btn(b)
    -- preload (L=0,R=1,U=2,D=3)
    local dirx = {-1,1,0,0}
    local diry = {0,0,-1,1}

    ------------------NEW CODE---------------------
    if butt<0 then return end
    -----------------------------------------------
    if b>=0 and b<4 then
        move_player(dirx[b+1], diry[b+1])
        return
    end
end
```

Lastly, we implement the `get_btn` function:

```lua
function get_btn()
    for i=0,5 do
        if btnp(i) then -- if button is pressed...
            return i -- return that
        end
    end
    return -1 -- else, return buffer default val
end
```

We just put this buffer in both our `update_game` and `update_pturn`
functions. Again, note that the execution of the input will only happen in
`update_game`:

```lua
function update_game()
    if buffer==-1 then
        buffer=get_btn()
    end
    exec_btn(buffer) -- execution only happens here
    buffer=-1
end
```

For `update_pturn`, we just want to fill the buffer in case the player
decides to press something while the sprite is still moving:

```lua
function update_pturn()
    if buffer==-1 then
        buffer=get_btn()
    end
    --- other movement functions...
end
```

*Et voilà!* We now have input buffering! Feel the difference:

## Conclusion

In this notebook, I learned alot about the basics of Pico-8 movement. Now I can
move a sprite in four directions, perform smoother tile transitions, and
improve game feel by buffering inputs. To be honest I still have a long way to
go, but I think this is a good start!
