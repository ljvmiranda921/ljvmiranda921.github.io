description: |
    Named-entity recognition (NER) datasets come in different shapes and sizes.
    This structure also contributes to how well machine learning techniques
    perform on said task. In this blogpost, we'll characterize a few NER
    datasets, and examine how its form affects its difficulty.

<!--

Spans are common in the following tasks:
- coref
- NER (nested NER), more common than you think!

Look at Spans as:
- a training objective
- a pretraining objective
- an optimization objective
