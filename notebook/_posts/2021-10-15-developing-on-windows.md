<span class="firstcharacter">R</span>ecently, I've been developing on a Windows
machine, and it was a magical experience. At first, I was anxious because of my
previous experience with Windows. Five years ago, installation instructions
won't *just work*, each step needs a workaround ([cygwin](https://cygwin.com),
[MSYS2](https://msys2.org), [Git Bash on Windows](gitforwindows.org) etc.), and
more. It was unpleasant. However, the ecosystem has changed for the better!

In this blogpost, I'll share some of the steps I took to make my machine
developer-friendly.
