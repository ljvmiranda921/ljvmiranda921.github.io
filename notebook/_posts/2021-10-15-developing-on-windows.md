<span class="firstcharacter">R</span>ecently, I've been developing on a Windows
machine, and it was surprisingly fun. At first, I was anxious because of my
previous experience with Windows. Five years ago, installation instructions
won't *just work*, each step needs a workaround ([cygwin](https://cygwin.com),
[MSYS2](https://msys2.org), [Git Bash on Windows](gitforwindows.org) etc.), and
a whole lot more. It was unpleasant. Now, I feel like the ecosystem has changed
for the better.

In this blogpost, I'll share some of the steps I took to make my machine
developer-friendly. Hope you find these helpful as much as I did:

- Install WSL2 and get the Windows Terminal
- Prettify your Powershell Prompt with Oh-My-Posh
- Install Windows Powertoys for more control
- Keep track of Windows Updates

## Install WSL2 and get the Windows Terminal

<!-- install NERD fonts -->
<!-- update themes in Windows Terminal -->


## Prettify your Powershell Prompt with Oh-my-Posh


## Install Windows Powertoys for more control


## Keep track of Windows Updates


## FAQs

- **Why did you change to Windows?** I've been gaming recently and some
      NVIDIA drivers don't work out-of-the-box on Linux, especially on current-gen
      GPUs. If they do, they cause weird errors like screen stuttering and
      blackouts. 
- **What made you took the leap?** Mostly curiosity. Some of my peers
      in my previous job use Windows for development (albeit with some pain-points). I'd like
      to see if I can create a delightful dev experience on a Windows Machine.
