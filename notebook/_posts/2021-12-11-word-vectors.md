<span class="firstcharacter">W</span>ord vectors are representations of words
into numbers. Once words are in this form, it becomes straightforward for a
computer to understand them. Of course, you can't just arbitrarily assign
numbers into words!

<!-- fun figure of cats and dogs with numbered indices -->
![](/assets/png/word-vectors/some_arbitrary_numbers.png){:width="520px"}
{:style="text-align: center;"}

We need to satisfy two conditions: first, is that these numbers should have
some meaning, or **semantics**. Second, is that we should **encode** meaning
into a numerical representation. If we're in the realm of numbers, a common way
to show meaning is to see how far one number is from another:

![](/assets/png/word-vectors/dope.png){:width="500px"}
{:style="text-align: center;"}

The hope is, words can also be represented as such. In the case of animals, 
one trait, or **feature**, that we can encode is its *leggedness.* Let's plot
our animals on a number line depending on the number of their legs:

![](/assets/png/word-vectors/leggedness.png){:width="560px"}
{:style="text-align: center;"}

That's not yet informative, all the animals were stacked on top of each other.
Perhaps we can add another feature, how about *tameness*? Let's create another
axis and place our animals across them:

![](/assets/png/word-vectors/tameness.png){:width="500px"}
{:style="text-align: center;"}

What we just did is that  we came up with features and encoded them into our
vectors.  As a result, we can now say that a dog is similar to a cat, entirely
different from a gecko, and so on.  


But we don't want to write all possible features one-by-one, we want to **exploit
existing knowledge** just for that. We also don't want to encode them manually, we'd
rather **write an algorithm to automate** that for us.

This gives us to two ingredients in creating word vectors:
1. An existing **corpus of knowledge** to get features automatically. Here, we
   can use newspaper clippings, scraped data from the web, scientific
   journals, and more!
2. An **encoding mechanism** to transfom that text into numbers. Instead of
   writing them manually, we encode it algorithmically.

## Word vectors from scratch

We'll use these two ingredients&mdash; the corpus and encoding
algorithm&mdash; to create **word vectors from scratch.** Some of these were
adapted from  [this
blogpost](https://towardsdatascience.com/creating-word-embeddings-coding-the-word2vec-algorithm-in-python-using-deep-learning-b337d0ba17a8).
We'll start from a small text corpus and end with a set of word vectors. The
process is as follows:

<!-- insert image of the process -->

![](/assets/png/word-vectors/process.png){:width="720px"}
{:style="text-align: center;"}

### <a id="corpus"></a> 0. Preliminary: the text corpus üìö

Earlier, we manually encoded our knowledge into some mathematical format. When
we spoke of *tameness*, we assigned values to each of our animals and plotted them
into the graph. This method is great if you only deal with one or two features.
But when you want to capture the nuance and meaning ascribed to those words,
it's not enough.

> In practice, we extract knowledge from other sources: books, the Internet, Reddit
> comments, Wikipedia, and more.

In practice, **we'd want to extract knowledge from other sources**&mdash;books,
the Internet, Reddit comments, Wikipedia...you name it! In NLP, we call
this collection of texts as the *corpus*.[^1] We won't be scraping any text for
now. Instead, we'll come up with our own:

```python
sentences = [
    "A dog is an example of a canine",
    "A cat is an example of a feline",
    "A gecko can be a pet.",
    "A cat is a warm-blooded feline.",
    "A gecko is a cold-blooded reptile.",
    "A dog is a warm-blooded mammal.",
    "A gecko is an example of a reptile.",
    "A mammal is warm-blooded.",
    "A reptile is cold-blooded.",
    "A cat is a mammal.",
]
```

What you see above are factual statements about animals. Think of them as a
sample of sentences you'll typically find in any corpus. In reality, ten
sentences aren't enough to generate a good model, you'd want a larger corpus
for that. For example, the [GloVe word
embeddings](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/) used Wikipedia, news
text, and the Internet ([CommonCrawl](https://commoncrawl.org/)) as its source.
It has hundreds of gigabytes of data, a million times more than the ten
sentences we have.

###  <a id="clean"></a> 1. Clean the text üßπ

We clean the texts by removing stopwords and punctuations.  In NLP, stopwords
are low-signal words that are uninformative and frequent.[^2]   A few examples
include articles (*a*, *an*, *the*), some adverbs (*actually*, *really*), and a
few pronouns (*he*, *me*, *it*).

Most libraries like [spaCy](https://spacy.io), [nltk](https://www.nltk.org/),
and [gensim](https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/) provide their own list of
stopwords. For us however, we'll stick to writing our own:

```python
STOP_WORDS = [
    "the",
    "a",
    "an",
    "and",
    "is",
    "are",
    "in",
    "be",
    "can",
    "I",
    "have",
    "of",
    "example",
    "so",
    "both",
]
```

We also write our own blacklist of punctuations:

```python
PUNCTUATIONS = r"""!()-[]{};:'"\,<>./?@#$%^&*_~"""
```

We can now write our text cleaning function, `clean_text`. This function first
removes the punctuation by scanning each character and checking if it belongs
to our list. Then, it removes a stop word by scanning each word in the text.
A sample implementation is seen below:

```python
from typing import List

def clean_text(
    text: str, 
    punctuations: str = PUNCTUATIONS, 
    stop_words: List = STOP_WORDS,
) -> List[str]:

    # Simple whitespace tokenization
    tokens = text.split()
    
    # Remove punctuations for each token
    tokens_no_puncts = []
    for token in tokens:
        for char in token.lower():
            if char in punctuations:
                token = token.replace(char, "")
        tokens_no_puncts.append(token)

    # Remove stopwords
    final_tokens = []
    for token in token_no_puncts:
        if token not in stop_words:
            final_tokens.append(token)

    return final_tokens
```

There's one step that we haven't talked about&mdash; **tokenization**. You can
see it subtly happening when we invoked `text.split()`. The goal of
tokenization is to segment our text into known boundaries. The easiest way to
achieve that is to split our sentence based on the whitespace, just like what
we did. 

```python
text = "A cat is a mammal."
print(clean_text(text))  # ["A", "cat", "is", "a", "mammal"] 
```

Note that **whitespace tokenization is not foolproof.** This method won't work
on languages that aren't dependent on  spaces (e.g., Chinese, Japanese,
Korean) or languages with different morphological rules (e.g., Arabic,
Indonesian). In fact, informal English also has a lot of special cases that
whitespace tokenization cannot solve (e.g. "Gimme" -> "Give me"). 

```python
# Cases where whitespace tokenization won't work
jp_text = "ÁßÅ„ÅÆÂ∞ÇÈñÄ„Åå„Ç≥„É≥„Éî„É•„Çø„Ç¢Â∑•Â≠¶ „Åß„Åô"
kr_text = "ÎπÑÎπîÎ∞•Î®πÏóàÏñ¥?"
```

In practice, you'd want to use more robust tokenizers for your language. For
example, spaCy offers a [Tokenizer API](https://spacy.io/api/tokenizer) that
can be customized to any language. spaCy uses its [own tokenization
algorithm](https://spacy.io/usage/linguistic-features#how-tokenizer-works) that
performs way better than our naive whitespace splitter. 


<!-- get the vocabulary -->
If we run our `clean_text` function to all our sentences and obtain all unique
words, we'll come up with a **vocabulary**:

```python
# Clean each sentences first. We'll get a list of lists inside the 
# all_text variable.
all_text = [clean_text(sentence) for sentence in sentences]

# We "flatten" our list and use the built-in set() function to get
# all unique elements of the list.
unique_words = set([word for text in all_text for word in text])
print(unique_words)  # ['canine', 'cat', 'coldblooded', ...]
```

From our small corpus, we obtained a measly vocabulary of size 10.  On the
other hand, the CommonCrawl dataset has 42 billion tokens of web data...well,
we can't be choosers, so let's move on!

### <a id="pairs"></a> 2. Create word pairs üêæ

As John Rupert Firth, a famous linguist, once said: *"You shall know a word by
the company it keeps."*[^3] In this step, we create pairs consisting of each word
in our vocabulary and its context ("the company it keeps"). We call the former
as the **center word** and the latter as the **context word**. 


<!-- a few image illustration of a sentence and center + context -->

![](/assets/png/word-vectors/context.png){:width="520px"}  
__Figure__: Demonstration of center and context words. Note that we skip
"a" and "is" because they're stopwords. The `clean_text` function should've
removed them at this point.
{:style="text-align: center;"}

> You shall know a word by the company it keeps - John Rupert Firth

**Context is important to understand meaning.** Take the word *bat* for 
example. We don't know what it means in isolation, but in a sentence, its
meaning becomes crystal clear:

<!-- a few image illustrate of bat as animal and bat as baseball bat -->
![](/assets/png/word-vectors/bat.png){:width="720px"}
{:style="text-align: center;"}

We can stretch this further: do you know the meaning of the words *frumious*,
*Jabberwock*, and *Jubjub*? Well, we can only guess. But in the context of
other words (in this case a poem), we can infer their meaning:

> Beware the Jabberwock, my son!  
> The jaws that bite, the claws that catch!  
> Beware the Jubjub bird, and shun  
> The frumious Bandersnatch!  

By looking at the context of each word, we now know that *Jabberwock* is a noun
and can be something dangerous because of the word 'beware.' It also has 'jaws'
and 'claws' that bite and catch.  *Frumious*, on the hand, is an adjective that
describes a *Bandersnatch*. Lastly, *Jubjub* could be a type of bird that one
should be beware of. Well...truth is, these words were just made up! I lifted
them from Lewis Carroll's poem,
["Jabberwocky"](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/42916/jabberwocky), in
the novel [*Through the
Looking-Glass*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Through_the_Looking-Glass).
Awesome, huh?

We can also control the neighbors of a word through its **window size**. A size
of 1 means that a center word only sees adjacent words as its neighbor. Too
high a window and your context becomes less informative, too low and you fail
to capture all of its nuance.

> Too high a window and your context becomes less informative, too low and you
> fail to capture all of its nuance.

Now, we write a function to get word pairs from a sentence:

```python
def create_word_pairs(
    text: List[str],
    window: int = 2
) -> List[Tuple[str, str]]:
    word_pairs = []
    for idx, word in enumerate(text):
        for w in range(window):
            if idx + 1 + w < len(text):
                pair = tuple([word] + [text[idx + 1 + w]])
                word_pairs.append(pair)
            if idx - w - 1 >= 0:
                pair = tuple([word] + [text[idx - w - 1]])
                word_pairs.append(pair)
    return word_pairs
```

Note that at this stage, we've already cleaned and tokenized our sentences.
We now pass a string of tokens and obtain a list of pairs.

```python
text = "A cat is a warm-blooded feline."
cleaned_tokens = clean_text(text)  # ["cat", "warm-blooded", "feline"]

# Get word pairs
create_word_pairs(cleaned_tokens)
```

From here we obtain six pairs:

```python
[('cat', 'warmblooded'),
 ('cat', 'feline'),
 ('warmblooded', 'feline'),
 ('warmblooded', 'cat'),
 ('feline', 'warmblooded'),
 ('feline', 'cat')]
```

We do this step for each text in our corpus. In the end, we obtain a large list
of pairs containing every word in our vocabulary and their corresponding
neighbor. The larger the corpus, the larger the expressivity of our word pairs. 

In a way, **having these pairs allows us to see which words tend to stick
together.**  Later on, we will train a model that can understand this affinity,
i.e., given a word $$X$$, what's the probability that a word $$Y$$ will show
up? In the next section, we'll jumpstart this stage by preparing our dataset.


###  <a id="vectors"></a> 3. Encode to one-hot vectors üñ•Ô∏è

After obtaining word pairs, the next step is to convert them into some numerical
format. We won't be overthinking this too much, so we'll treat those numbers
similar to how we treat words&mdash; as discrete symbols. We accomplish this
with **one-hot encoding**.

In one-hot encoding, we prepare a table where each word in our vocabulary is
represented by a column. Our word columns don't have to be in a specific order,
although I prefer sorting them alphabetically. To encode a word, we simply write
`1` in the column where it is located and write `0` elsewhere:

<!-- illustration of one-hot encoding -->
![](/assets/png/word-vectors/one_hot.png){:width="720px"}
{:style="text-align: center;"}

So for our corpus with a vocabulary size of 10, we create a table with ten columns. 
To encode the word `cat`, we write `1` in the second column (where `cat` is located) and `0`
elsewhere. This gives us the encoding:

```python
>>> one_hot_encode("cat")  # I will show its implementation later!
[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
```

One advantage of one-hot encoding is that it allows us to interpret the encoded
vector as a probability distribution over our vocabulary. For example, if I have
a center word `cat`, we can then check how likely other words in our vocab will
appear as a context word:

```python
# Note: not actual values. A highly-contrived example
# Numbers are just provided for illustration
>>> {v: l for v, l in vocab, get_likelihood("cat"))}
{
 "canine": 0.01,
 "cat": 0.27, 
 "coldblooded": 0.01,
 "dog": 0.06,
 "feline": 0.22,
 "gecko": 0.04, 
 "mammal": 0.11,
 "pet": 0.07,
 "reptile": 0.02,
 "warmblooded": 0.19,
}
```

> One-hot encoding allows us to interpret the encoded vector as a
> probability distribution over our vocabulary.

This also means that if we have the following word pair `("cat", "feline")`,
their encoding can be interpreted as: "the word *feline* is likely to appear
given that the word *cat* is present." It is consistent as long as we think of
zeroes and ones as probabilities:

```python
>>> one_hot_encode("cat")
[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
>>> one_hot_encode("feline")
[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
```

<!-- add illustration -->
![](/assets/png/word-vectors/one_hot_probs.png){:width="720px"}  
__Figure__: Vectors can also be interpreted as a probability distribution
over the vocabulary. This means that in one-hot encoding, a value of 1 may also
mean a highly-probable event.  
_(Note: this is a highly-contrived example)_
{:style="text-align: center;"}

> One advantage of one-hot encoding is that it allows us to interpret the
> encoded vector as a probability distribution over our vocabulary.

Now, let's write a function to create one-hot encoded vectors from all our word
pairs and vocabulary. The vocabulary will guide us on the placement and length
of the one-hot vector. Lastly, instead of taking a single word, we'll take a list
of word pairs to make things easier later on:

```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def one_hot_encode(
    pairs: List[Tuple[str, str]], 
    vocab: List[str]
) -> Tuple[List, List]:

    # We'll sort the vocabulary first. 
    # It's not required, but it makes bookkeeping easier
    n_words = len(sorted(vocab))

    ctr_vectors = []  # center word placeholder
    ctx_vectors = []  # context word placeholder

    for pair in pairs:

        # Get center and context words
        ctr, ctx= pair
        ctr_idx = vocab.index(ctr)
        ctx_idx = vocab.index(ctx)

        # One-hot encode center words
        ctr_vector = [0] * n_words
        ctr_vector[ctr_idx] = 1
        ctr_vectors.append(ctr_vector)

        # One-hot encode context words
        ctx_vector = [0] * n_words
        ctx_vector[ctx_idx] = 1
        ctx_vectors.append(ctx_vector)

    return ctr_vectors, ctx_vectors
```

Now if we pass all our word pairs and vocabulary, we'll get their corresponding
one-hot encoded center and context vectors:

```python
sample_word_pairs = [("cat", "feline"), ("dog", "warm-blooded")]
vocab = ["canine", "cat", "cold-blooded", ...]

center_vectors, context_vectors = one_hot_encoded(sample_word_pairs, vocab)
print(center_vectors) 
# gives: 
# [[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], 
#  [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
# for "cat" and "dog", our center words
print(context_vectors) 
# gives: 
# [[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], 
#  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]]
# for "feline" and "warm-blooded", our context words
```

In the next section, we will be using these two sets of vectors to train a
neural network model. The center vectors will act as our inputs, whereas the
context vectors will act as our labels.


### <a id="train"></a> 4. Train a model ü§ñ 

Because we now have a collection of center words with their corresponding context
words, it's now possible to build a model that asks: "**what is the likelihood
that a context word $$y$$ appears given a center word $$X$$?**" or simply,
$$P(y\vert x ; \theta)$$.

To illustrate this idea: if the words *warm-blooded*, *canine*, and *animal* often appear
alongside the word *dog*, then that means we can infer something informative
about dogs. We just need to know how likely these words will come up, and that
will be the role of our model.

To train a model, we will **use the center words as our input, and the context
words as our labels**. We will build a neural network of size 10-2-10 with a
softmax layer in its output:

![](/assets/png/word-vectors/nn.png){:width="720px"}
{:style="text-align: center;"}

- **Input layer (size 10)**: we set our input layer to the size of our vocabulary.
    We don't need to add an activation layer, so we just leave it as it is.
- **Hidden layer (size 2)**: this can be any arbitrary size, but I set it to 2 so that
    I can plot the weights in a graph. It's also possible to set a higher number, and perform
    Principal Component Analysis (PCA) later on.
- **Output layer (size 10 with softmax)**: we set the number of nodes to 10 so
    that we can compare it with the context vectors. The softmax activation is
    important so that we can treat the output as probabilities and use cross-entropy
    loss. To learn more about softmax, check my post on the [negative
    log-likelihood](/notebook/2017/08/13/softmax-and-the-negative-log-likelihood/). 

Now, let's construct our neural network. We'll use the following third-party
modules:

```python
import torch
import torch.optim as optim
from torch import nn
```

We build our network based on the size of our center and context vectors.
For the hidden layer, we set an arbitrary size of 2. 

```python
# Prepare layer sizes
input_dim = len(center_vectors[0])
hidden_dim = 2
output_dim = len(context_vectors[0])

# Build the model
model = nn.Sequential(
    nn.Linear(input_dim, hidden_dim),
    nn.Linear(hidden_dim, output_dim),
)
```

Next we prepare our loss function and optimizer. We will use cross-entropy loss
to compute the difference between the model's output and the context vector. In
Pytorch, softmax is already included when using the
[`torch.nn.CrossEntropyLoss`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.CrossEntropyLoss.html)
class, so there's no need to add it in our model definition:

```python
# In Pytorch, Softmax is already added when using CrossEntropyLoss
loss_fn = torch.nn.CrossEntropyLoss()
optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=1e-4)
```

We also convert our vectors into Pytorch's
[`FloatTensor`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/tensors.html) data type. At this
stage, I'll also call the center and context vectors as  `X` and `y`
respectively, just to be consistent with common machine learning naming schemes:

```python
X = torch.FloatTensor(center_vectors)
y = torch.FloatTensor(context_vector)
```
Lastly, we write our training loop. Because we're using a deep learning
framework, we don't have to write the backpropagation step by hand. Instead, we
simply [call the `backward()`
method](https://discuss.pytorch.org/t/what-does-the-backward-function-do/9944)
from the loss function: 

```python
for t in range(int(1e3)):
    # Compute forward pass and print loss
    y_pred = model(X)
    loss = loss_fn(y_pred, torch.argmax(y, dim=1))
    # Zero the gradients before running the backward pass
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    # Backpropagation
    loss.backward()
    # Update weights using gradient descent
    optimizer.step()
```

After training the model, we can now access its weights. We'll
obtain, in particular, the weights between the input and hidden layers:

```python
name, weights = list(model.named_parameters())[0]
w = weights.data.tolist()
```

**These weights are, in fact, our word vectors&mdash; congratulations!**
They are of the same size as our hidden layer. I've set their dimension to 2 so
that we can plot the vectors right away into a graph. In the next section,
we'll show what this graph looks like to get a deeper look into the behaviour of
our word vectors.

### <a id="weights"></a> 5. Post: on word vectors üßÆ 

After training our model, we took the weights between the input and hidden
layers to obtain our word embeddings. We specifically chose these weights
because they act as **a lookup table for translating our one-hot encoded vectors
into a more suitable dimension.**  

> The intermediary weight matrix (weights between the input and hidden layers)
> acts as a lookup table that translates one-hot encoded vectors into a different
> dimension.


![](/assets/png/word-vectors/lookup_table.png){:width="720px"}
__Figure__: Our weight matrix, coupled with the one-hot encoded input, acts as a lookup table.
{:style="text-align: center;"}


And this is definitely what we want. One-hot encoded vectors are sparse and
orthogonal: there's really nothing *that* informative between `[0 0 ... 1 0]`
and `[1 0 ... 0 0]`. Instead, we want a dense vector where we can draw
meaningful semantic relations from. Our weight matrix performs this
transformation for us. 

By having these dense and continuous relationships, we can even represent them into
a graph!

<!-- illustration of your plot -->

Notice how semantically related words are nearer to each other. For example, the
words *gecko*, *reptile*, and *cold-blooded* were clustered together. The same
goes for *cat*, *dog*, and *warm-blooded*. Even more so, these clusters of
"lizards" and "mammals" are further far apart!

We didn't encode these relationships, it was all due to how the model
interpreted the words from our corpus. Sure, we wrote these sentences ourselves,
but in practice we just have to scrape them from somewhere. 

## Conclusion

In this blogpost, we looked into the idea of generating our own word vectors
from scratch. We achieved this by combining (1) a text corpus and (2) an
encoding mechanism. The word vectors we generated are crude, but we learned a
few things on how they came about. Truth is, what we just did is similar to the
[original skip-gram implementation of Word2Vec](https://arxiv.org/abs/1301.3781)
(Mikolov, et al, 2013): given a text corpus, we generate word pairs and train a
neural network across them.

In production, it is more ideal to use ready-made word embeddings&mdash;they are
more robust and generalizable. Of course, [real-world NLP still requires
finetuning](https://explosion.ai/blog/applied-nlp-thinking), but using these
vectors should already give you a headstart.

Lastly, I hope that this exercise made us more aware of how a text corpus can be
a source of bias: a corpus made up of Reddit comments will produce an entirely
different model compared to a corpus lifted from an encyclopedia. We can use
this for better or for worse: we can train "domain-specific" language models to
[min/max](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=min%2Fmax) our task,
or release models in the wild that are inherently biased. Real-world NLP isn't
as easy as figuring out cats and dogs.

    *Corpus* literally means body, as in "a body of text." Also, its plural form is *corpora*, not "corpi." Fun!

    Writing tip: I use stopwords to gauge how clear my writing is. Sometimes,
    when I use a lot of stopwords my writing becomes full of fluff.

    and modern statistical NLP as a whole!
