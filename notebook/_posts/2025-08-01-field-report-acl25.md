    I learned a lot about X, got excited about Y, and had lots of fun all throughout!

<span class="firstcharacter">I</span> had an incredible time at the [ACL 2025 Conference](https://2025.aclweb.org/) in Vienna.
ACL is one of the top conferences in NLP, with researchers presenting a wide range of work from computational linguistics to frontier large language models.
This was also the very first NLP conference I attended.
Although I published in these venues before, I never had a chance to attend physically.
Attending ACL was also a great way to immerse myself in the wider NLP community before I start my Ph.D.
