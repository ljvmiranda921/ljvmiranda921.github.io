    It seems that any software engineer is expected to know how to debug.
    However, there's not much material or structured framework on how to
    do it. In this blog, I share my own debugging "mental framework" through
    some pixel art!

## Introduction

There was a time when I was tasked to maintain a system, and fix it iteratively
whenever users report bugs. I was **not** on building-mode: the priority
isn't the next killer feature or the next phase in the roadmap&mdash;it's
simply to ensure that the software is working as expected. During those weeks
of squashing bugs and triaging errors, I realized that debugging isn't as
straightforward as I thought it was!

**Debugging seems to be a skill expected from anyone entering into tech, but
the knowledge on how to effectively do so is siloed-out.** It makes sense
because as you learn how to code, you've certainly hit errors and you've
debugged your way out of it. Then, as we go through our own tech journeys, we
developed a tacit knowledge[^1] on how to debug.

I then realized that I don't have a "mental framework" on how to debug effectively.
For the most part, I'm just relying on my tacit knowledge and practical
experience. Hence, I devised a three-part framework for myself, and I'm sharing
it to you through Pixel Art[^2]!

## Code R.E.D.

<!-- emergency light pixel art animation??? -->

**Why Code RED?** RED hints at urgency: imagine those movie scenes where
enemy aliens attack and all emergency alarms are set off&mdash;that's how I imagine
the process of debugging. Of course, in the middle of an emergency, I don't
want to lose my composure, so Code R.E.D. also stands for the mental framework
that I'm trying to practice. Lastly, Code RED sounds nice, it's on theme
with my Space Force pixel art below!

### R is for Reproduce




### E is for Execute


### D is for Document

## Conclusion


### Footnotes

[^1]: I think of tacit knowledge as know-how that is not explicitly defined or transferrable&mdash; just like riding a bike.
[^2]: Yes, I do Pixel Art!
