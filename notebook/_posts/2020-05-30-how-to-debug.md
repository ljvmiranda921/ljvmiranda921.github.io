    It seems that any software engineer is expected to know how to debug.
    However, there's not much material or structured framework on how to
    do it. In this blog, I share my own debugging "mental framework" through
    some pixel art!

## Introduction

There was a time when I get to maintain a system that we've built, and fix it
iteratively whenever users encounter any bugs. Hence, we're **not** on
building-mode: the priority isn't the next killer feature or the next phase
in the roadmap. During those weeks of squashing bugs and triaging errors, I
realized that debugging isn't as straightforward as I thought it was!

**Debugging seems to be a skill expected from anyone entering into tech, but
the knowledge on how to effectively do so is siloed-out.** It makes sense
because as you learn how to code, you've certainly hit errors and you've
debugged your way out of it. Then, as we go through our own tech journeys, we
developed a tacit knowledge[^1] on how to debug.

I then realized that I don't have a "mental framework" on how to debug effectively.
For the most part, I'm just relying on my tacit knowledge and practical
experience. Hence, I devised a three-part framework for myself, and I'm sharing
it to you through Pixel Art[^2]!

## Code R.E.D.

### R is for Reproduce


### E is for Execute


### D is for Document

## Conclusion


### Footnotes

[^1]: I think of tacit or latent knowledge as know-how that is not explicitly defined&mdash; just like riding a bike. Got the idea from latent knowledge in [representation learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1206.5538) (Bengio, Courville, and Vincent, 2012).
[^2]: Yes, I do Pixel Art!
