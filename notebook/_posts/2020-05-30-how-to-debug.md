## Introduction

There was a time when I was tasked to maintain a system, and fix it iteratively
whenever users report bugs. I was **not** on building-mode: the priority
isn't the next killer feature or the next phase in the roadmap&mdash;it's
simply to ensure that the software is working as expected. During those weeks
of squashing bugs and triaging errors, I realized that debugging isn't as
straightforward as I thought it was!

**Debugging seems to be a skill expected from anyone entering into tech, but
the knowledge on how to effectively do so is siloed-out.** It makes sense
because as you learn how to code, you've certainly hit errors and 
debugged your way out of it. Then, as we went through our own tech journeys, we
developed a tacit knowledge[^1] on how to debug.

I realized that I don't have a "mental framework" on how to debug effectively.
Usually, I just rely on my tacit knowledge and practical
experience. Hence, I devised a short three-part framework for myself, and I'm sharing
it to you through Pixel Art[^2]!

## Code R.E.D.: my mental framework for debugging

The color red hints at urgency, just like those movie scenes where enemy aliens
attack and emergency alarms are set off&mdash;that's how I see the process of
debugging. 

R.E.D. is also an acronym for the mental framework that I'm trying
to practice: it sounds nice, and on theme with my Space Force pixel art!


### R is for Reproduce

One of my first steps in debugging is to reproduce the bug in a controlled
environment. I do this in order to confirm that the bug exists, and to isolate
it given a minimum set of variables. 

I reproduce bugs by ensuring that I accomplish the following in my project:

- **Create a minimum working environment**: this may include the version where
    the bug was discovered, dependencies, error/stack-trace, and a ["minimal, complete verifiable
    example"](https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example). For
    my open-source work, I automate this using [Github's Issue templates](https://help.github.com/en/github/building-a-strong-community/configuring-issue-templates-for-your-repository).
- **Setup my project so that it's easier to reproduce parts of the code**: I do
    this by pinning dependency versions, writing readable logs and error
    messages, and keeping an updated local dev setup instructions.


### E is for Execute

When I was still starting out, I immediately jump into this step and brute
force my way into the debugging process. As I squashed more bugs in my career,
I learned how to be tactical, thorough, and precise. There's a logical reason
why bugs happen, and it's important to narrow-down what causes this behaviour.

There are three tools that helped me in this process: loggers, debuggers,  and
the test suite:

- **Loggers provide more context on the bug**: I setup my logger so that I
    know when the bug happened, what has happened, and where it happened in the
    source-code. For Python I use [loguru](https://github.com/Delgan/loguru)
    and for Golang I use [logrus](https://github.com/sirupsen/logrus).
- **Debuggers enable me to inspect variables as I untangle the bug**: this tool has some learning curve, but was made worth it as I don't need to put a lot of `print` statements around my code (and more!). In Python, I simply use the built-in
    debugger [`pdb`](https://realpython.com/python-debugging-pdb/).
- **Test suite makes me more defensive when debugging**: before and after I
    debug, I ensure that the test suite passes. In addition, I found
    that it is important to setup a CI/CD system so that it's easier for me to iterate
    along the way.


### D is for Document

Documentation is one of the most important and forgotten parts of
debugging&mdash;I know because I'm guilty! There are plenty of  benefits in
documenting code, some of these we may already know by now: easier for others
(including future us) to read our code, good way to step-back from biz logic to
more high-level thought, and keeps a history of our project.

I try to document bugs (and their fixes) by following these practices:
- **Writing and running [regression tests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_testing) to document bug behaviour**: these tests allow me
    to express the logic, in code, that causes the bug. Ideally, these tests
    shouldn't break in the future whenever the business logic is updated.
- **Ensuring that commit messages are detailed enough**: I'm a big fan of
    Chris Beam's tutorial on writing [commit
    messages](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/). As a practice, I
    describe in the commit the bug it's trying to solve, and my thought process
    as to why these changes were done. In addition, I ensure that the
    Github/JIRA Issue was referenced in the commit.
- **Keeping a Changelog**: there are notable benefits for [keeping a
    changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/). In the context of
    debugging, it documents on a high-level what bugs were fixed on a specific
    version of the software. I try to automate this as much as possible, but
    I also recommend writing it yourself!

## Conclusion

In this blog post, I talked about my Code R.E.D. framework on debugging. It's
an acronym for a three-step process that I follow whenever I want to squash
some bugs: *R* for **Reproduce**, *E* for **Execute**, and *D* for
**Document**. I also explained some practices that I follow as I go through
each step. You might notice that these guidelines are still rough, but I think
that having a simple methodology on how to approach debugging is helpful. 

Lastly, I hope that you enjoyed the Pixel art, and adopt the Code R.E.D.
framework into your own workflows! If you wish to see more of my fledgling
attempts in pixel art, follow me on my Twitter art account,

### Footnotes

[^1]: I think of tacit knowledge as know-how that is not explicitly defined&mdash; like riding a bike.
[^2]: Yes, I've been learning pixel art for the past month!
