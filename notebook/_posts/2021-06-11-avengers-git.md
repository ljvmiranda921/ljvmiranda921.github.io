<span class="firstcharacter">W</span>hen I first saw *Avengers: Endgame* in
theaters, I noticed that **their time travel rule is quite similar to the Git
branching model.** Referred to as the [*time
heist*](https://marvelcinematicuniverse.fandom.com/wiki/Time_Heist), our heroes
travelled through time to recover the stones and undo the effects of the
snap&mdash; thereby saving all. 

> The Ancient One: "The Infinity Stones create what you experience as the folow
> of time. Remove one of the stones, and the flow splits."

Creating branches and alternate realities...*isn't that vaguely familiar with
Git?* As it turns out, software developers are doing their own version of
time-travel in their day jobs! Let me demonstrate that in this blogpost by
**explaining the plot of *Avengers: Endgame* in five git concepts!**

<!-- Note to Lj: remember, these five are happening in sequence! -->


## Fast-forward merge

<!-- five years later -->


## Checkout a point in the past 


<!-- find an object in commit history -->
<!-- time heist -->



## Headless and stray branches 

<!-- whlie checking out the commit, our heroes are in a headless branch -->
<!-- loki is a stray branch -->


## Merge conflict

<!-- thanos wants to rebase to master -->
<!-- i am not sure what iron man did: not accept merge-ours and not accept thanos
pull request, or actually delete the thanos from another timeline? -->


## Rewriting history with rebase 

<!-- more speculative: captain america going back -->
<!-- are there two captain americas in the `master` timeline now? -->
<!-- did the original captain america (the one we followed through the years) just hid himself properly and let history take its natural course without making action? -->
