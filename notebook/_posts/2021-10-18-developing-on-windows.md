<span class="firstcharacter">R</span>ecently, I've been developing on a Windows
machine, and it was surprisingly fun. At first, I was anxious because of my
previous experience with Windows. Five years ago, installation instructions
won't *just work*, each step needs a workaround,[^1] and
things break often. It was unpleasant. Now, I feel like the ecosystem has
changed for the better.

In this blogpost, I'll share some of the steps I took to make my machine
developer-friendly. Hope you find these helpful as much as I did:

- [Install WSL2, Windows Terminal, and VSCode](#wsl2)
- [Prettify your PowerShell Prompt](#powershell)
- [Install Microsoft Powertoys for more control](#powertoys)

## <a id="wsl2"></a> Install WSL2, Windows Terminal, and VSCode

[Installing **Windows Subsystem for Linux 2
(WSL2)**](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10) feels like
cheating because I'm literally just running Linux. Installation was painless,
and [all my dotfiles](https://github.com/ljvmiranda921/dotfiles) for
[vim](https://www.vim.org/), [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki), and
bash worked out of the box. Also, you can choose any distro you want from the
Microsoft Store! I'm pretty basic so I went with Ubuntu 20.04.

I also installed **Visual Studio Code (VSCode)** since it can seamlessly open
files in both my Windows and Linux filesystems. Back then, I was bitten by the
[CRLF problem](https://owasp.org/www-community/vulnerabilities/CRLF_Injection)
when opening files between the two. This has been solved in VSCode.

However, I wouldn't even stop there. Instead of using the "WSL2 Terminal," I
went for the **Windows Terminal** (you can also find it in the Microsoft Store).
It's an emulator where you can open PowerShell, Command Prompt, and Bash in
multiple tabs! 

![](/assets/png/windows-dev/multiple_tabs.png){:width="540px"}  
__Figure__: *If you look at the top, then you can see that I can open Bash, PowerShell, and the Windows Command Prompt in just one place using Windows Terminal*
{: style="text-align: center;"}


It's customizable too. You can [change the color
scheme](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/terminal/customize-settings/color-schemes)
and the font. Personally, I love using [Gruvbox
Dark](https://gist.github.com/davialexandre/1179070118b22d830739efee4721972d)
and [Fira
code](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/tree/master/patched-fonts/FiraCode).[^2]

![](/assets/png/windows-dev/settings.png){:width="540px"}  
__Figure__: *You can update the font and color scheme in the Settings tab*
{: style="text-align: center;"}

After a few tweaks, my terminal already looks like the one I've been accustomed
to in my Linux machine.

__Figure__: *With WSL2 and Windows Terminal, I was able to replicate my Linux setup*
{: style="text-align: center;"}

Lastly, another thing I did is to set Bash as my default profile, and update
the starting directory to `//wsl$/Ubuntu-20.04/home/$USER/`. So whenever I open
the Windows Terminal, the bash profile is automatically loaded and is set to
the actual `home` directory for Linux.


## <a id="powershell"></a>Prettify your PowerShell Prompt

Now that I'm looking at Windows with my more experienced developer eyes, I was
curious as to how I can get around the OS through the shell. Previously, I've
always used the GUI. With that, I learned that the main entrypoint is through
**PowerShell**. 

I don't really see myself writing PowerShell scripts in the future. So in order
to dip my toes into the environment, my tiny task is to *prettify my terminal.*

### PowerShell

However, we won't be using the pre-installed "Windows PowerShell" for our
tasks. Instead, we will download *another PowerShell* (named just "PowerShell")
[from the Microsoft
Store](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/powershell/9mz1snwt0n5d#activetab=pivot:overviewtab).
Confusing? Yeah, here's what I got:

* The pre-installed PowerShell, or *Windows PowerShell* (or PowerShell 5.1) is
    a Windows-only program that relies on an older .NET Core runtime. It's no
    longer in active development aside from bug-fixes.
* The new PowerShell, named *PowerShell* (or PowerShell 7.x) supports
    cross-platform development. So programs developed there can run on
    Windows, macOS, and Linux. 

You can check your PowerShell version by typing `$PSVersionTable` and checking
the value in the `PSVersion` key. On my machine, PowerShell 7.x is installed
side-by-side with PowerShell 5.1. I am not sure if it's possible to upgrade 5.1
to 7.X., so I opted to keep them separate.

__Figure__: *After installing Powershell, calling `PSVersionTable` shows the 7.x version*
{: style="text-align: center;"}

Personally, it feels similar to the Python 2 to 3 conundrum. Sometimes it's
okay to keep them both so as to not break anything in your system.

### Install chocolatey

The next thing I did is to download the **[Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/)
package manager**. We will use it to install the prompt theme engine for
PowerShell. You can liken Chocolatey  to `apt` in Linux. Also, note that it's a
third-party app, as there is an official package manager by the name
[winget](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/package-manager/winget/).

I chose Chocolatey over winget because the former seems more mature and is
feature-complete. To be honest, I am not sure of all the nuances between the
two. A [quick Reddit search on "winget vs
chocolatey"](https://www.google.com/search?q=winget+vs+chocolatey+site%3Areddit.com&oq=winget+vs+chocolatey+site%3Areddit.com)
shows some hesitation from other developers over winget. As for me, I value
stability, so I just went with Chocolatey.


### Install Oh-My-Posh

[**Oh-My-Posh**](https://ohmyposh.dev/) is a prompt theme engine for customizing PowerShell. I found this
through [Scott Hanselman's blogpost on making your terminal
pretty](https://www.hanselman.com/blog/my-ultimate-powershell-prompt-with-oh-my-posh-and-the-windows-terminal).
To install it via Chocolatey, I ran:

```powershell
choco install oh-my-posh
```

Then, I have to add the following line to my `$PROFILE`:

```powershell
oh-my-posh --init --shell pwsh --config ~/jandedobbeleer.omp.json | Invoke-Expression
```

I spent an hour figuring out where that `$PROFILE` file is located. Turns
out, you can find it at:

```
C:\\Users\%USER%\Documents\Powershell\Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1
```

If you haven't configured your PowerShell profile before, then that file may
not exist yet. Create one and copy the `oh-my-posh` line above. Instead of
navigating through your File Explorer, you can jump ahead using VSCode by typing:

```powershell
code $PROFILE
```

You can also
[change your
theme](https://ohmyposh.dev/docs/windows#override-the-theme-settings) by
updating the `--config` option. There's a [wide selection of
themes](https://ohmyposh.dev/docs/themes), but I opted to use
[nu4a](https://github.com/JanDeDobbeleer/oh-my-posh/blob/main/themes/nu4a.omp.json)
as it fits nicely to Gruvbox.

```powershell
# Pre-installed themes can be found in ~\AppData\Local\Programs\oh-my-posh\themes\*.omp.json
oh-my-posh --init --shell pwsh --config ~\AppData\Local\Programs\oh-my-posh\themes\nu4a.omp.json | Invoke-Expression
```

__Figure__: *At first, some glyphs won't render properly. We'll fix that by installing a NerdFont-compatible typeface
Most fonts were already patched, so you'll most likely find a patched version of your favorite font.*
{: style="text-align: center;"}

At first, the prompt looks weird because some glyphs didn't render properly. To
fix that, I used the [patched version of Fira
Code](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/tree/master/patched-fonts/FiraCode)
so that I have access to all icons and shapes.

![](/assets/png/windows-dev/patched.png){:width="540px"}  
__Figure__: *After installing the patched font, the powerline should now render properly.*
{: style="text-align: center;"}

I decided to be more extra and installed Terminal Icons. This adds small and
cute icons whenever you type `ls` and `dir`. I installed it by typing the
command below:

```powershell
Install-Module -Name Terminal-Icons -Repository PSGallery
```

and by adding the following line in my `$PROFILE`:

```powershell
Import-Module -Name Terminal-Icons
```

now it looks awesome!

__Figure__: *I installed `Terminal-Icons` because I want to be more extra*
{: style="text-align: center;"}

## <a id="powertoys"></a>Install Microsoft Powertoys for more control

Lastly, I installed [Microsoft
Powertoys](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/powertoys/) to help improve
my developer experience. You can think of it as a collection of tools bundled
into one package. One of my favorites are:

- [**Powertoys
    Awake**](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/powertoys/awake): it
    functions similarly to Linux's [Caffeine
    Indicator](https://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/bionic/man1/caffeine-indicator.1.html),
    where you can toggle your display to remain on for an indefinite amount of
    time. I find it perfect for long-running tasks, or when I just want my
    screen to be on while I'm away from my desk.
- [**Keyboard
    Manager**](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/powertoys/keyboard-manager)
    allows me to remap keys however I want. I used this to rebind my <kbd>Caps
    Lock</kbd> key to  <kbd>Esc</kbd>, so that I have less "travel time" when
    using Vim. I think that using Keyboard Manager is safer than editing
    registry files directly, so I went for this option.

Aside from these two, there are still a lot of utilities included in Powertoys,
but I still have to check them out yet.


## FAQs

- **Why did you change to Windows?** I've been gaming recently and some
      NVIDIA drivers don't work out-of-the-box on Linux, especially on current-gen
      GPUs. If they do, they cause weird errors like screen stuttering and
      blackouts.  
- **What made you take the leap?** Mostly curiosity. Some of my peers
      in my previous job use Windows for development (albeit with some pain-points). I'd like
      to see if I can create a delightful dev experience on a Windows Machine.
- **You're overselling it a bit, now tell me about the quirks** Sure, yanking to/from clipboard is not straightforward in Vim, 
    [network assignment is buggy (I need to restart to get
    connection)](https://github.com/microsoft/WSL/issues/5336), and nested
    virtualization (running Docker) is not yet solid. However, I still find
    these issues a bit minor (the first two can easily be solved by some
    tweaks), so I'm sticking on WLS2 for now.

### Footnotes

[^1]: I remember back then, I use alternatives like [Cygwin](https://www.cygwin.com), [MSYS2](https://www.msys2.org), and [Git Bash on Windows](https://git-scm.com/downloads) to emulate a Linux-like experience. It was fun so I decided to jump head-on to a full Linux installation.
[^2]: I use NerdFont's patched version of [Fira Code](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Fira+Code). With that, you can access almost a thousand icons to prettify your terminal.
