    The lack of Tagalog gold-standard NER data inhibits us from training decent
    structured prediction pipelines for our language. In this blog post, I talk
    about the state of Tagalog-based corpora, my progress on building a
    gold-standard dataset, and my hopes for the future of Tagalog NLP.
