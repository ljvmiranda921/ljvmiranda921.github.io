    The lack of Tagalog gold-standard NER data inhibits us from training decent
    structured prediction pipelines for our language. In this blog post, I'll talk
    about the state of Tagalog-based corpora, my progress on building a
    gold-standard dataset (and its limitations), and my hopes for the future of Tagalog NLP.

<span class="firstcharacter">T</span>agalog is my native language. It's spoken
by 76 million Filipinos and has been our official language since the 30s. 
Stories and songs have been written in Tagalog. It's a **text-rich** language,
but unfortunately, a **low-resource** one. In this blog post, I'll talk about
the state of Tagalog-based corpora, my experience on creating a gold-standard
dataset (including its limitations), and my hopes for the future of Tagalog NLP.

## Tagalog corpora is low-resource, full of silver-standard annotations
