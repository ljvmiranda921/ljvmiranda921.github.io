As a regular MRT-3 passenger, the idea of congestion is strongly familiar. In
fact, the ebb and flow of passengers give rise to some familiar patterns that
we observe in our everyday commute. We notice peak hours, highly-congested
stations, and overall traffic. In this notebook, I will explore these
patterns in our MRT-3 system through data. The data was sourced from the
[open data website](http://dotr.gov.ph/) of the Department of Transportation
and Communication (DOTC). This short analysis is divided into three parts:

- [Peak hours of the day](#peak-hours-of-the-day)
- [Passenger Traffic throughout the day](#station)
- [Passenger flux](#passenger-flux)

## Peak hours of the day

Below we can see how many passengers, on average, move in and out of the MRT
system throughout the day.

Peak hours in the MRT range from 6:00 to 9:00 in the morning and 4:00 to 7:00
pm in the afternoon. These peak hours correspond to the time when people go
to work in the morning and go back home in the afternoon. We can then observe
how large the difference is, in terms of the number of passengers, in between
the two peak hours.

Although it can easily be advised to _avoid the rush hour_, not all employees
are privileged to do that. Riding the MRT-3 by 5:00 AM is a huge sacrifice
(imagine going up very early in the morning for your 8:00 AM work!), and
leaving work before 5:00 PM is impossible. Some people find a hack by
delaying their travel time by staying at the office until the evening; in
which we can see, that the frequency of passengers diminishes through the
night.

##  <a name="station"></a> Passenger Traffic throughout the day

Next, I would like to see how congestion differs for each station throughout
the day. In this case, I created a heatmap, where intense colors represent
higher congestion. All the MRT-3 stations are at the y-axis, and the hour of
the day at the x-axis.

Looking at the heatmap on the left, we can see the stations where most people
enter: North Avenue Station and Taft. We can also see in the same map that
Taft Station always has a constant influx of passengers throughout the day.
In addition, the North Avenue congestion can be attributed to the fact that
most employees go to work in places like Makati and Ayala, thus congesting
the Southbound trip. It may take a lot of urban planning, but it is important
that the congestion in the first station is distributed evenly among the
other stations. This may entail the addition of jobs and offices that can be
located near these points.

As we progress through the day, we can see the peak points (or areas of
stronger intensity) developing along Araneta, Shaw, and Ayala. Intuitively,
these places are all near Commercial Business Districts (CBD), and we see an
influx of people entering these stations around our peak hours.

In our right-hand heatmap, we can then see the frequency of passengers that
alight the MRT. In the morning, we see most of them exiting through Shaw (and
some in Ortigas), Ayala, and Taft. In the afternoon/evening, most of the
people alight the MRT in Araneta, Taft, and North Avenue. This is then
consistent to the idea that most employees from the North go Southbound to
work in places like Makati. In fact, if we look in our same heatmap, we can
observe (in the morning) the places where people go, and the places where
people go home to (in the evening).

## Passenger Flux

I am then interested on how passenger flow changes througout the day. Below
is an animated chart showing areas of higher passenger frequency (more
intense colors) with respect to the stations throughout the day.

{: style="text-align: center;"}

In the morning, we see that the influx of passengers often originate in the
north, specifically in North Avenue, Quezon Avenue, and GMA Kamuning. Over
time, we can then see how the congestion in the stations build-up, as more
people are going in from different points of the MRT. We can also observe the
stations where most passengers alight, and it is consistent to our
observations from the heatmaps above.

In addition, as we progress through the night, we can see that the outflow of
passengers develop in Araneta, and more so in North Avenue. It is then
evident that the passenger flux in the morning go Southbound, while in the
afternoon they go Northbound.

## Conclusion

It is interesting how data can help us see patterns especially in a
transportation system like the MRT. From data, we can determine usage
patterns and see how they develop throughout the day. I hope that in the
future, more fine-grained data will be collected for the MRT-3 (and perhaps
for our other train lines as well). As of now, the data we have is coarse,
and seems to generalize a lot. It may be interesting to see usage patters in
the weekend, and the exact origin-destination of passengers that take the
MRT-3
