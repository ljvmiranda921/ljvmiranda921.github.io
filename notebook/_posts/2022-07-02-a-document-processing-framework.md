<span class="firstcharacter">E</span>xtracting information from PDFs and
scanned documents may not be the sexiest problem of the century. You don't
generate paintings nor control robots to play games. It's pure busywork,
something that "AI" has promised to automate but failed to achieve. That's why
I developed a keen interest in **document processing**, *the task of converting
analog data into digital format*, as it evokes a subtle challege&mdash;a
problem statement so simple yet tough to do.

As I have worked with different organizations throughout my career, I learned
that **document processing is ubiquitous**&mdash;from corporations to NGOs, small
organizations to large conglomerates&mdash; there's always a PDF that needs to
be digitized! Solving this problem even has significant ramifications: for
example, archival climate data that can help scientists understand the growing
global crisis is locked in paper documents. It turns out that document
processing is not just hard but also urgent. 

This blog post describes **a framework for designing document processing
solutions**. It also has a sample implementation using Prodigy and Hugging
Face. This framework has three principles:
