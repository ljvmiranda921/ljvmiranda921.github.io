<span class="firstcharacter">E</span>xtracting information from PDFs and
scanned documents may not be the sexiest problem of the century. You don't
[generate paintings](/notebook/2021/08/08/clip-vqgan/) nor [control robots to
play games](/projects/2018/09/14/pfn-internship/). It's pure *busywork*,
something that "AI" has promised to automate but failed to achieve.[^1] That's
why I'm interested in document processing, the task of
**converting analog data into digital format**, as it evokes a subtle
challenge&mdash;a problem statement so simple yet tough to solve.

After working with different organizations, I realized that document processing
is ubiquitous&mdash;from corporations to NGOs, small organizations to large
conglomerates&mdash; there's always a PDF that needs to be digitized!  **Solving
this problem even has significant ramifications**: [archival climate
data](https://public.wmo.int/en/our-mandate/what-we-do/observations/data-rescue-and-archives)
that can help scientists understand the growing global crisis is locked in paper
documents. So document processing is not just hard; it may also be urgent.

This blog post describes **a framework for designing document processing
solutions**. It has three principles:

- **Annotation is king**: there is no silver bullet. Even in the presence of a
good model, you still need to finetune with your data. Ideally, you'd want an
annotation tool with finetuning built-in or flexible enough to incorporate
this mechanism.

- **Make multimodal models**: we don't just rely on text whenever we analyze
a document. Instead, we take all information (position, text size, etc.) as
context. Being able to use all these features is vital. A pure OCR or a pure
text-based approach is suboptimal to solve this task.

- **Always be correcting**: OCR and document layout models aren't always
perfect, so it's essential to keep the human-in-the-loop to correct your
system's outputs. You can use correction to retrain your model or as the
penultimate step before saving the results in a database.

We'll see this framework in action as we go through my
sample implementation using [Prodigy](prodi.gy) and [Hugging
Face](huggingface.co) in the next section.

## Framework in action: form understanding

We'll focus on the task of **form layout analysis.** Unlike tables, forms vary in
their template, confusing even the most complex business rules.  We will be
using the [**FUNSD dataset**](https://guillaumejaume.github.io/FUNSD/) for this
task. It consists of noisy scanned documents where the challenge is to determine
the header, question, answer, and other relevant information.

> FUNSD: Form Understanding in Nosy Scanned Documents is a dataset for text
> detection, optical character recognition, spatial layout analysis, and form
> understanding.

If I were to design a solution that incorporates all the principles above, then
it would look like the figure below. It's a diagram of how I envision a typical
document processing workflow:

{:style="text-align: center;"}

Notice how each step corresponds to a particular design principle. To implement
this solution, **I will be using [Prodigy](prodi.gy) and the LayoutLMv3 model
from Hugging Face**. [Prodigy](prodi.gy) is an annotation tool that allows
us to [write custom scripts](https://prodi.gy/docs/custom-recipes) tailor-fit to my
problem (for full disclosure, I currently work at [Explosion](https://explosion.ai)). By translating the
principles above into Prodigy recipes, I can come up with the following figure:

__Figure__: Document processing solution design principles as Prodigy recipes
{:style="text-align: center;"}

Here are the Prodigy recipes we will use:

- `image.manual`: is a built-in recipe that allows us to load images from a directory and add bounding box annotations.
- `image.train-pdf`: is a custom recipe that finetunes a [LayoutLMv3 model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.08387) given an annotated dataset. 
- `image.qa`: is a custom recipe that takes in a finetuned LayoutLMv3 model and a directory of test images for correction and quality assurance.

You can find a sample implementation of these recipes in this [Github
repository](https://github.com/ljvmiranda921/prodigy-pdf-custom-recipe):

### Annotation is king

Annotation is always a given in any document processing solution. Documents tend
to vary wildly in appearance, even if they have distinguishable patterns.  So
you'd want an annotation tool that allows you to label documents reliably.

In Prodigy, this functionality is already built-in using the `image.manual`
recipe. Given a directory of images, we can draw bounding boxes or freeform
polygons to label specific regions. For FUNSD, it looks like this:

<!-- insert FUNSD sample in Prodigy -->
![](/assets/png/dpt/prodigy_funsd.png){:width="500px" style="padding:10px"}  
__Figure:__ The `image.manual` annotation interface in Prodigy.
{:style="text-align: center;"}

Whenever we label, Prodigy stores the annotations in a
[database](https://prodi.gy/docs/api-database). Because FUNSD already has
annotations, we don't need to label anymore. So instead, I will hydrate the
database with the annotated values to recreate the scenario. The [`hydrate-db`
command](https://github.com/ljvmiranda921/prodigy-pdf-custom-recipe/blob/master/project.yml#L32)
from the [project
repo](https://github.com/ljvmiranda921/prodigy-pdf-custom-recipe) illustrates
this process.

One limitation of this approach is that we didn't do OCR because the text data
is already available. The `image.manual` recipe only stores the bounding boxes
and the labels. However, we can solve this by creating a custom recipe that
performs OCR to give us bounding boxes and an interface that allows us to label
each bounding box with a corresponding value.[^2]

### Make multimodal models

Another reason why document processing is such an appealing problem is that it
is inherently multimodal&mdash;textual and visual information is readily
available for us to use. But unfortunately, crude document processin gsolutions tend to take
advantage of only one type:

- Pure visual approaches involve a lot of complex business rules around bounding
boxes and text placement to get the required info. They often end up relying on
templates that may not be scaleable.
- Pure textual approaches run on NLP pipelines on OCR'd text. However, blobs of
text are incompatible with the domain these models were initially trained from,
causing suboptimal performance.




### Always be correcting




## Final thoughts

This blog post describes what I think are the most critical aspects of a
document processing solution: an annotation mechanism, a multimodal model, and
an evaluation step. I also demonstrated them in action using Prodigy
and LayoutLM. 

Machine learning was promised to automate manual labor. But it seems that we
hit a wall and started automating creative endeavors instead. My take is that
we optimized research for silver-bullet solutions: feed one big model with
input, and you get the desired output. Manual labor, such as document
processing, isn't like that. Instead, they tend to be bespoke: you need to
label data, you need to consider all elements of your document, you need to
correct your model's output&mdash;and one big model won't cut it. 

I hope that this framework can help you in your automation challenges. Feel

    I resonate with [Tom MacWright's
    tweet](https://twitter.com/tmcw/status/1511804741747154944) on how much of
    the progress in ML right now focuses on automating the creative facets of
    the human condition, such as writing and art. This [Tweet thread by Freya
    Holm√©r](https://twitter.com/FreyaHolmer/status/1532261886078631940?s=20&t=d0vBdUKklmHq-8G2mWYecw)
    also gives an interesting view of how AI generated art can affect the craft.

    I will be creating a sample project in the future demonstrating this.
