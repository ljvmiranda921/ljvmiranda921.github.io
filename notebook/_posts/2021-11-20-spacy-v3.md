<span class="firstcharacter">B</span>ack then, when I want to train my own NER
model using [spaCy](https://spacy.io), I'd write my own training loop.
Something like this:

```python
with nlp.disable_pipes(*other_pipes):
  for i in range(epochs):
    random.shuffle(train_set)
    batches = minibatch(training_data, size=64)
    for batch in batches:
        text, annotations = zip(*batch)
        nlp.update(texts, annotations, drop=0.5, losses=losses)
```
__Code:__ A simple training loop for NER.  
Adapted from [Duygu Altinok](https://duygua.github.io/)'s book, ["Mastering spaCy"](https://www.packtpub.com/product/mastering-spacy/9781800563353)
{: style="text-align: center;"}

It was pretty good until I started handling multiple NLP projects: I would
rewrite the same code over and over again, teams would develop competing
standards of what goes into the loop, and third-party integration would become
nontrivial&mdash;it can get messy in no time!

Also, the snippet above is still incomplete&mdash;a full solution would be much
more involved. To complete my training loop, I have to write code to set my
learning rate, customize my batching strategy, initialize my weights, and so
on!

This year, [spaCy released v3](https://explosion.ai/blog/spacy-v3#config)
and introduced a more convenient system for NLP projects. If there's one key
takeaway from this blogpost, then it's that **you don't have to write your own
training loop anymore**.  With that said, here's how I think about the "spaCy
stack" now:

![](/assets/png/modern-spacy/spacy_stack_full.png){:width="380px"}  
__Figure:__ My view of the spaCy stack.  
Abstraction increases as you go up.
{: style="text-align: center;"}

In this blogpost, we'll go through the stack in increasing levels of
abstraction. First, we'll look into the [configuration
system](https://spacy.io/usage/training#quickstart), and see how it abstracts
our custom-made training loop. Then, we'll look into [spaCy
projects](https://spacy.io/usage/projects), and see how it abstracts our
configuration and NLP workflow as a whole. Lastly, I'll share a few thoughts as
a spaCy user and developer.

- [Final thoughts](#final-thoughts)


## The spaCy configuration system

If I were to redo my NER training project again, I'll start by generating a
`config.cfg` file:

```sh
python -m spacy init config --pipeline=ner config.cfg
```
__Code:__ Generating a config file for training a NER model
{: style="text-align: center;"}

Think of `config.cfg` as our main hub, a complete manifest of our training
procedure. We update it using any text editor, and "run" it through the [spaCy
command-line interface (CLI)](https://spacy.io/api/cli).

![](/assets/png/modern-spacy/user_intxn_config.png){:width="800px"}  
__Figure:__ I can interact with the config via the spaCy CLI.  
It is already included whenever I install spaCy
{: style="text-align: center;"}

I'll talk about my way of managing them later, but first, let's continue by
setting-up our train and dev datasets. Note that it's still `null` in our
config:

```ini
# ... excerpt
[paths]
train = null
dev = null
# ... excerpt
```
__Code:__ At first, the paths to our training and evaluation data is still null.  
We need to provide valid paths for each.
{: style="text-align: center;"}


Even if we donâ€™t have to write our training loop, chances are, we still need to
write our data preprocessing step. But if our dataset follows standard formats
like CoNLL-U, then we skip this step and just convert it with the [`spacy
convert`](https://spacy.io/api/cli#convert) command.

![](/assets/png/modern-spacy/user_intxn_data.png){:width="800px"}  
__Figure:__: Unless your dataset follows common formats, you need to write a data processing script
to convert them into `DocBin`, then into the disk.
{: style="text-align: center;"}


Even if our preprocessing step is tightly-coupled to our dataset, we'd want it
to be saved as a [`DocBin`](https://spacy.io/api/docbin) object (with a `.spacy`
extension). Due to [spaCy's efficient
serialization](https://spacy.io/usage/saving-loading#docs), saving our dataset
into this format gives us the benefit of working on smaller files. Below is a
sample recipe adapted from
[`explosion/projects`](https://github.com/explosion/projects/blob/9d5fce5f95ddf5f35c3370b2074b25e995525f51/pipelines/ner_demo/scripts/convert.py):



```python
def convert(lang: str, input_path: Path, output_path: Path):
    """Convert a pair of text annotations into DocBin then save"""
    nlp = spacy.blank(lang)
    doc_bin = DocBin()
    for text, annot in srsly.read_json(input_path):
        doc = nlp.make_doc(text)
        ents = []
        for start, end, label in annot["entities"]:
            span = doc.char_span(start, end, label=label)
            if span is None:
                msg = "Skipping"
            else:
                ents.append(span)
        doc.ents = ents
        doc_bin.add(doc)
    doc_bin.to_disk(output_path)
```
__Code:__ Here's one way of converting files into a `DocBin` object.
{: style="text-align: center;"}


We have now streamlined our process. Previously with spaCy v2, I'd have to save
my training data into an intermediary
[`GoldParse`](https://v2.spacy.io/api/goldparse) object. With v3, I only have to
think about my dataset's [`Doc`](https://spacy.io/api/doc) representation,
nothing more.

Once we're done, we should have a `.spacy` file for both our
training and evaluation datasets.  We can go ahead and provide the paths in our
`config.cfg` file:

```ini
[paths]
train = "path/to/train.spacy"
dev = "path/to/dev.spacy"
# ... rest of the configuration
```
__Code:__ We now have the `.spacy` files in our configuration. It's also
possible to override them via CLI using `--paths.train` or `--paths.dev` parameters.
{: style="text-align: center;"}

Just to be sure, I'd also run [`debug`](https://spacy.io/api/cli#debug)
commands before training. My favorite is `debug data`: it informs me of invalid
annotations and imbalanced labels.  Once everything checks out, training my NER
model becomes as easy as running:

```sh
python -m spacy debug data config.cfg
```
__Code:__ Check if there are any data inconsistencies
{: style="text-align: center;"}

Once everything checks out, training my NER model becomes as easy as running:

```sh
python -m spacy train config.cfg --output ./output
```
__Code:__ Training via the spaCy CLI becomes straightforward
{: style="text-align: center;"}

After training, the `./output` folder will contain our best model, which I can
now use just like any other spaCy model. I could either pass the path to
[`spacy.load`](https://spacy.io/usage/models#quickstart), or get some metrics
by using the [`spacy evaluate`](https://spacy.io/api/cli#evaluate) command.

![](/assets/png/modern-spacy/user_intxn_full.png){:width="800px"}  
__Figure:__ Common user workflow for spaCy CLI and its configuration system
{: style="text-align: center;"}

&mdash;and that's it! Again, we don't need to write our training loop anymore. In
fact, you even remove the need to write auxiliary scripts for training&mdash;
say, a custom CLI using [click](https://click.palletsprojects.com/en/8.0.x/) or
[typer](https://typer.tiangolo.com/). **It all boils down to your `config.cfg`
file and (optional) data preparation script.** The spaCy CLI handles
everything.

![](/assets/png/modern-spacy/spacy_stack_config.png){:width="380px"}
{: style="text-align: center;"}

However, if you're just like me who feels secure knowing which code runs when a
command is executed, then feel free to check the table below. It lists down, in
decreasing levels of abstraction, the code being run whenever `spacy train` is
executed.

### How to manage your config


The config file presents us with _all_ the options we need to successfully train
our model. Sure, it looks overwhelming at first, but the upside is that we get
**all the relevant information in one place**. With that, it becomes easier to
reproduce experiments, and trace differences across our models.

However, if you prefer looking at a file with a minimal set of options, then you
can create a `base_config.cfg` with the partial list you need, and fill it
with the `fill-config` subcommand:


![](/assets/png/modern-spacy/user_intxn_partial.png){:width="700px"}  
__Figure:__ You can manage your config by filling a partial set of values
first,  
then hydrating them with the full set of options.
{: style="text-align: center;"}


```ini
# base_config.cfg contains a partial list of options
[paths]
train = "path/to/train.spacy"
dev = "path/to/dev.spacy"

[nlp]
lang = "en"
pipeline = []
batch_size = 5000
```
__Code:__ Base config with a partial list of options
{: style="text-align: center;"}


When running `spacy train`, you should still pass the config with the full list
of options, i.e `config.cfg`. So even if my `base_config.cfg` only contains
settings for `batch_size` (because maybe that's what I only care about for now)
the resulting `config.cfg` will still include all parameters and defaults to
successfully train our model.

Personally, I still prefer to work with the full configuration itself. I don't
have to maintain two files, nor remember to run `fill-config` everytime I
change one.  Just be mindful during major version updates: the `fill-config`
command may differ and introduce variability in your setup, rendering it
irreproducible. As a best practice, pin your dependencies to mitigate this
scenario.


### How to understand your config

Having all parameters spelled out means that there are no hidden defaults to
secretly mess up our training. So whenever I come across an unfamiliar setting,
what I do is **follow the breadcrumbs in the spaCy documentation.**

> Whenever I come across an unfamiliar parameter (in my configuration file), 
> what I usually do is follow the breadcrumbs in the spaCy documentation.

Take a look at this example. Let's say I want to know more about the
`compounding.v1` schedule in `[training.batcher.size]`:

```ini
# ... excerpt
[training]
seed = 42
gpu_allocator = "pytorch"
dropout = 0.1
accumulate_gradient = 1
patience = 1600
max_epochs = 0
max_steps = 20000

[training.batcher]
@batchers = "spacy.batch_by_words.v1"
discard_oversize = false
tolerance = 0.2
get_length = null

[training.batcher.size]
@schedules = "compounding.v1"
start = 100
stop = 1000
compound = 1.001
t = 0.0
# ... excerpt
```
__Code:__ An excerpt of a configuration file focused on the training step. We
will be looking at how the `batcher` was configured for the rest of this
section.
{: style="text-align: center;"}


The first thing I'd do is check the section it belongs to; in our case it's
`[training]`. Then, I'll head over to the
[`"training"`](https://spacy.io/api/data-formats#config-training) section of
spaCy's [data format documentation](https://spacy.io/api/data-formats). There,
we can view all available settings, their expected types, and what they do:

![](/assets/png/modern-spacy/training_section.png){:width="700px"}
__Figure__: Notice that the `batcher` is a function (a `Callable`).
{: style="text-align: center;"}

From our config, these settings may be located either (1) in the `[training]`
section itself or (2) in its own subsection. The latter just means that it can
still be configured further, especially when that parameter takes a function or
a dictionary.

For example, if we zoom into the `batcher` option, we'll notice that it
requires a function (or
[`Callable`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.Callable)) as
its input. Thus, we assign it into its own subsection. There, we specify the
exact function to use for batching&mdash; `spacy.batch_by_words.v1`.

![](/assets/png/modern-spacy/batcher_demo_00.png){:width="680px"}  
__Figure__: The `batcher` parameter for training can still be configured further,  
so it earns its own subsection.
{: style="text-align: center;"}

Now, we can go deeper into this batching method. We can find the full spec of
the `batch_by_words` method by looking at spaCy's [top-level API
documentation](https://spacy.io/api/top-level#batchers): 

![](/assets/png/modern-spacy/training_batchers.png){:width="700px"}
{: style="text-align: center;"}

Notice that the same pattern repeats: `discard_oversize` and `tolerance` can't
be configured further, so we just snug them under the same subsection. On the
other hand, `size` can refer to a scheduler *function*, so it has its own
subsection:

```ini
# ... excerpt
[training.batcher.size]
@schedules = "compounding.v1"
start = 100
stop = 1000
compound = 1.001
t = 0.0
# ... excerpt
```

![](/assets/png/modern-spacy/batcher_demo_01.png){:width="680px"}  
__Figure__: Similar to `batcher`, we can configure the `size` further.
{: style="text-align: center;"}

If we still want to learn more about the `compounding.v1` schedule, then we can
check the [Thinc
documentation](https://thinc.ai/docs/api-schedules#compounding).
[Thinc](https://thinc.ai) powers spaCy, and sits a layer below it:
:

![](/assets/png/modern-spacy/thinc_stack.png){:width="300px"}  
__Figure__: [Thinc](https://thinc.ai) is a layer that powers spaCy's compute capabilities. It offers a refreshing take on deep learning frameworks via a functional paradigm. It also
exists as [a standalone library](https://github.com/explosion/thinc)
{: style="text-align: center;"}


Notice that the way we traversed the configuration is from top to bottom: we
started with the main components of the training workflow (`training`), then
peeled layers of abstraction until we reach more specific settings
(`compounding.v1`).  By doing so, we have also traversed the spaCy stack! 

In the next section, we'll move up the stack to [spaCy
projects](https://spacy.io/usage/projects). If the config file governs your
training loop, then spaCy projects govern your [entire machine learning
lifecycle.](/notebook/2021/05/10/navigating-the-mlops-landscape/)

## The spaCy project system

An abstraction above spaCy's configuration system is [spaCy
projects](https://spacy.io/usage/projects): if the config system is just about
training models, then spaCy projects is about the larger machine learning
workflow (i.e., training, packaging, productionizing, etc.).

> about the larger machine learning workflow.

<!-- insert image of stack -->
![](/assets/png/modern-spacy/spacy_stack_projects.png){:width="340px"}
{: style="text-align: center;"}

I lied a bit earlier: if I were to start an evergreen NLP project, then I'll
start by cloning [one of the prebuilt
projects](https://github.com/explosion/projects) for my use-case. For my NER
example, I'd use the [NER demo
pipeline](https://github.com/explosion/projects/tree/v3/pipelines/ner_demo):  

```sh
python -m spacy project clone pipelines/ner_demo
```

From here on in, everything is up to us. Our main point of interaction is the
`project.yml` file, where we define how our project will look like. Its
structure is akin to a `Makefile`, enabling us to define steps or workflows
beyond model training:

![](/assets/png/modern-spacy/user_intxn_projects.png){:width="640px"}  
__Figure__: The spaCy project now abstracts our training config file. You can
use the `project.yml` file to manage our whole machine learning workflow. We
can then use the `spacy project run <STEP>` to execute
[steps](https://spacy.io/usage/projects#run) or
[workflows](https://spacy.io/usage/projects#run-workfow).
{: style="text-align: center;"}

If I am working on a typical NLP use-case, I'd first check if there's an
equivalent pipeline in
[explosion/projects](https://github.com/explosion/projects), and clone that.
NER and text-categorization already have pre-made templates that are
well-optimized for said task. The remaining thing to do is adapt my dataset
into the `DocBin` format.

Whenever I define workflows, I usually start by outlining what I want to do in
the `commands` section before jumping right into the code. For example, in text
categorization, I may just have something like this:

```yaml
# ... excerpt
commands:
- name: "preprocess"
  help: "Serialize raw inputs to spaCy formats"
  script:
  - "python scripts/preprocess.py assets/train.txt corpus/train.spacy"
  - "python scripts/preprocess.py assets/dev.txt corpus/dev.spacy"

- name: "train"
  help: "Train the model"
  script:
  - "python -m spacy train configs/config.cfg"

- name: "evaluate"
  help: "Evaluate the best model"
  script:
  - "python -m spacy evaluate training/model-best corpus/test.spacy"
# ... excerpt
```
__Code:__ I'd usually start by outlining the general steps of my pipeline,  
and draw out the typical workflow I want to accomplish.
{: style="text-align: center;"}

Under the `script`,  I usually write "dummy commands" that aren't implemented yet;
it's like **scaffolding your project before building it.** By planning how my
scripts will run beforehand, it's as if I'm writing the human-to-computer API
first.

The `project.yml` file also allows us to explicitly define expected
inputs and outputs for each step using the `deps` and `outputs` keys. For
example, the `evaluate` command as shown below will require that a test set,
`corpus/test.spacy`, exists before running:


```yaml
# ... excerpt
commands:
- name: "evaluate"
  help: "Evaluate the best model"
  script:
  - "python -m spacy evaluate training/model-best corpus/test.spacy --output metrics/best_model.json"
  deps:  
  # the spaCy cli will expect that corpus/test.spacy exists
  # before running the command
  - "corpus/test.spacy"
  outputs: 
  # the spaCy cli will expect that metrics/best_model.json is produced
  # after running the command
  - "metrics/best_model.json"
# ... excerpt
```
__Code:__ I take advantage of spaCy's dependency checks: it gives me a clear
sense of what data or  model goes in and out of each step.
{: style="text-align: center;"}

By doing so, we can easily see our step's dependencies and command chain. This
is one of my favorite features because I often get bitten by missing files or
hidden requirements. This also allows me to
[push and pull artifacts](https://spacy.io/usage/projects#remote) into a remote
storage.

The good thing about `project.yml` is that it supports **a top-down approach to
problem solving**: I can outline a big-picture view of my project first&mdash;
with all its dependencies and outputs&mdash; then work my way through the details.

Lastly, it also has some conveniences like [automatically generating
documentation](https://spacy.io/usage/projects#custom-docs), and [integrations
with popular tools](https://spacy.io/usage/projects#integrations).[^2] By using
one of the premade pipelines in spaCy projects, it becomes easier to tap into
the larger ML ecosystem.

## Final thoughts

As someone who has used spaCy since they learned NLP, it's awesome to see how
convenient and well-integrated it is with other tools! Of course, migrating a
project is not easy, especially if a dependency had a major change. There are
use-cases where spaCy's config and project system work best, and I'd like to
outline them here:

| Use-case                                             | spaCy version | Suggestion                                                                                              |
|------------------------------------------------------|---------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Starting a new NLP project                           | use v3        | Start using v3 and take advantage of the project templates and config system.                            |
| NLP project in production and using the train config | v3            | Awesome! You can marginally adapt the project system, but of course if it ain't broke, don't change it. |
| NLP project in production with custom training loop  | v3            | Try using atleast the config system and evaluate the results with your current model as baseline.        |
| NLP project in production, but using spaCy v2        | v2            | If possible, migrate to v3 (while being mindful of your model versions). Or [seek help from Explosion](https://form.typeform.com/to/vMs2zSjM)!   |


As usual, standard software engineering practices still apply: always pin your
dependencies, ensure your environments are reproducible, and [if it ain't
broke, don't fix
it](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/if%20it%20ain%27t%20broke%2C%20don%27t%20fix%20it).
However, if you are intent on making the jump, be sure to check out the
[migration guide](https://spacy.io/usage/v3#migrating) from the spaCy docs. The
[old v2 docs](https://v2.spacy.io/) are also up so you can reference them from
time to time.
