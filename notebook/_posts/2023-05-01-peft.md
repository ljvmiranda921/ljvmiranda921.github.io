<span class="firstcharacter">F</span>inetuning is a way to adapt pretrained
language models (LMs) to a specific task or domain. It requires attaching a task
head to the model and updating the weights of the entire network. However, this
process can put a strain on one's compute budget. This becomes more true as
language models get larger and larger in every release.

In this blog post, I want to share my notes on **parameter-efficient finetuning
techniques (PEFT).** Here, we only finetune a small number of parameters
while keeping most of the LM parameters frozen. As a result, PEFT allows domain
adaptation at a lower compute (and storage) cost. Lastly, this blog post is not a
literature review; I will only discuss methods I personally like. For each PEFT,
I will talk about its overview, related works, and high-level implementation.

## Finetuning is the de facto transfer learning technique, but it has become inefficient

To recap, pretrained language models like BERT ([Devlin et al.,
2019](#devlin2019bert)) contain contextualized word representations that capture
the meaning of each token and its context within the text. By themselves,
they're already useful. However, language models have enjoyed greater
versatility and state-of-the-art performance because of finetuning ([Howard and
Ruder, 2018](#howard2018ulmfit)).

Much of the pretrained LMs we use today are based on transformer networks
([Vaswani et al., 2017](#vaswani2017attention)). Let's review its architecture,
as it will help us understand the PEFT techniques later on. Recall that most
transformer networks consist of a stack of encoder and decoder layers with an
attention mechanism:


![](/assets/png/peft/transformer_network.png){:width="700px"}  
{:style="text-align: center;"}

The encoder layer consists of two sub-layers: an attention layer and a
feedforward network. Its outputs are passed to the decoder, consisting of the
same two sub-layers plus a cross-attention mechanism that attends the encoder's
output. Between each sub-layer, there is a residual (or skip) connection that is
normalized through LayerNorm ([Ba et al., 2016](#ba2016layernorm)). 

For transformers like BERT, there is no generative step, hence it only contains
encoders. Here's what a typical encoder layer looks like:

![](/assets/png/peft/inside_encoder.png){:width="600px"}  
{:style="text-align: center;"}


```python
# Pseudocode of a typical encoder layer
class Encoder:
    def __call__(self, x: Tensor) -> Tensor:
        residual = x
        x = MultiHeadAttention(x)
        x = LayerNorm(x + residual)
        residual = x
        x = FeedForwardLayers(x)
        x = LayerNorm(x + residual)
        return x
```

This encoder-only transformer uses multi-head attention, where the attention 
function is applied in parallel over $$N_h$$ heads. So given (1) a sequence of
$$m$$ vectors $$\mathbf{C}\in \mathbb{R}^{m\times d}$$ which we will perform
attention to, and a (2) query vector $$\mathbf{x} \in \mathbb{R}^{d}$$,
multi-head attention computes the output on each head and concatenates them:

$$
MultiHeadAttention(\mathbf{C}, \mathbf{x}) = Concat(head_1, \dots, head_h)\\
where~~head_i = Attention(\mathbf{x}\mathbf{W}_q^{(i)}, \mathbf{C}\mathbf{W}_k^{(i)}, \mathbf{C}\mathbf{W}_v^{(i)})
$$

And the feedforward network consists of a two linear transformations with a ReLU activation
function:

$$
Feedforward(\mathbf{x}) = ReLU(\mathbf{x}\mathbf{W}_1 + \mathbf{b}_1)\mathbf{W}_2 + \mathbf{b}_2
$$

One common way to finetune is to attach a task-specific head at the end of a
pretrained language model then train the entire network on our labeled data.[^1]
Although these LMs were trained on different tasks (for example, BERT was
trained on masked language modeling and next sentence prediction), it is
possible to refine its weights for other NLP problems (e.g., sentence tagging,
sequence classification, etc.).

![](/assets/png/peft/finetuning.png){:width="700px"}  
{:style="text-align: center;"}


However, this process has become inefficient ([Treviso et al.,
2023](#treviso2023efficient)). The number of parameters in pretrained language
models has increased exponentially, exacerbating fears in an LM's environmental
impact ([Strubell et al., 2019](#strubell2019energy)) and making them
inaccessible in resource-constrained and consumer-grade environments.  Hence, an
efficient approach to finetuning is becoming more desirable.



[^1]:

    Note that it's also possible to freeze the entire pretrained LM and only
    update the weights of the task-specific head. However, this process only
    works if the task-specific data is small to avoid overfitting. In most
    cases, updating both set of weights leads to better performance on the task
    at hand.

## We can make the finetuning process more efficient and modular

Recently, I've been interested in parameter-efficient techniques (PEFT) that are
modular in nature. Most of these involve creating small, trainable modules
(sometimes a feedforward network or a special matrix) that we attach to
different parts of a larger, pretrained network. Usually, we keep the larger
network frozen while we train the smaller modules on our data. 

> Most [parameter-efficient techniques] involve creating small, trainable modules
> that we attach to different parts of a larger, pretrained network.

**I like parameter-efficient and modular techniques because they appeal to my
engineering sensibilities.** I like the ["separation of
concerns"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns) between our
network's fundamental understanding about language (pretrained network) and its
task-specific capabilities (modular network), as opposed to training a single
monolithic model. We can even aggregate these modules to solve multi-domain
([Gurugangan et al., 2022](#gurugangan2022demix); [Chronopoulou et al.,
2023](#chronopoulou2023adaptersoup); [Asai et al., 2022](#asai2022attempt);
[Pfeiffer et al., 2021](#pfeiffer2021adapterfusion)) or multilingual problems
([Pfeiffer et al., 2020](#pfeiffer2020madx); [Pfeiffer et al.,
2021](#pfeiffer2021unks)). 

I won't be talking about every technique in this post. Instead, I'll focus on
methods that I like. For a more comprehensive overview, I highly recommend
looking at [Treviso et al.'s (2022)](#treviso2022efficient) survey of efficient
NLP techniques and [Pfeiffer et al.'s (2023)](#pfeiffer2023modular) work on
modular deep learning.

- [Adapters: attach small, trainable modules between transformer layers](#adapters-attach-small-trainable-modules-between-transformer-layers)
- [Prompt and prefix tuning: attach tunable parameters near the transformer input](#prompt-and-prefix-tuning-attach-tunable-parameters-near-the-transformer-input)
- [LoRA: decompose transformer weight updates into lower-rank matrices](#lora-decompose-transformer-weight-updates-into-lower-rank-matrices)

### Adapters: attach small, trainable modules between transformer layers

[Houlsby et al. (2019)](#houlsby2019peft) first proposed the use of adapters in the context of NLP.
The idea is to attach a small feedforward network *after* each transformer
sub-layer and tune it while keeping the larger network frozen: 

![](/assets/png/peft/encoder_with_adapter_houlsby.png){:width="600px"}  
{:style="text-align: center;"}

```python
# Pseudocode of a typical encoder layer with adapter
class EncoderWithAdapter:
    def __call__(self, x: Tensor) -> Tensor:
        residual = x
        x = MultiHeadAttention(x)
        x = AdapterNetwork(x)  # Usually another feedforward layer
        x = LayerNorm(x + residual)
        residual = x
        x = FeedForwardLayers(x)
        x = AdapterNetwork(x)  # Usually another feedforward layer
        x = LayerNorm(x + residual)
        return x
```

The adapter consists of a bottleneck architecture with a down- and
up-projection, similar to autoencoders. It also contains an internal
skip-connection. According to [Houlsby et al. (2019)](#houlsby2019peft), they were able to limit the
number of trainable parameters to $$0.5-8\%$$ of the original model.

```python
# Pseudocode of an adapter network
class AdapterNetwork:
    def __call__(self, x: Tensor, m: int) -> Tensor:
        residual = x
        d = get_dims(x)
        x = DownProjection(input_dim=d, output_dim=m)
        x = NonLinearity(x)
        x = UpProjection(input_dim=m, output_dim=d)
        return x + residual
```


From then on, researchers have proposed alternative adapter architectures. One
notable development is from [Pfeiffer et al.  (2021)](#pfeiffer2020adapterhub),
where they reduced the number of adapters significantly by attaching only one
adapter per transformer layer with minimal performance degradation. Alternative
adapter approaches also include training only the bias parameters as in BitFit
([Ben Zaken et al., 2022](#benzaken2021bitfit)), learning a task-specific
different vector as in diff-pruning ([Guo et al., 2021](#guo2021diffpruning)),
or connecting adapters in parallel ([He et al., 2022](#he2021parallel)).

> Most adapters consist of a bottleneck architecture with a down- and up-projection

However, I'm more interested in composing adapters together to solve
multi-domain, multi-task, or multilingual problems.[^2] They add another level of
flexibility to PEFT:
- **Multi-domain**: For example, [Chronopoulou et al.
(2023)](#chronopoulou2023adaptersoup) trained an adapter for each domain and
computed its weight-space average at test time. They dubbed this as an
AdapterSoup. The idea for "model soups" were based from [Wortsman et al.
(2022)](#wortsman2022modelsoup) and was inspired by convex optimization
techniques.

- **Multi-task**: [Pfeiffer et al.'s (2021)](#pfeiffer2021adapterfusion) work on
AdapterFusion attempts to transfer knowledge from one task to another by
combining their corresponding adapter representations. The "fusion" is done by
introducing a new set of parameters $$\Psi$$ (separate from the pretrained LM and adapter
parameters, $$\Theta$$ and $$\Phi$$) that learn to combine all the task adapters:

$$
\Psi \leftarrow argmin_{\Psi} L_{m} (D_m; \Theta, \Phi_1, \dots, \Phi_{N}, \Psi)
$$

- **Multilingual**: The MAD-X framework ([Pfeiffer et al., 2020](#pfeiffer2020madx)) trains 
a language-specific adapter module via masked language modeling for the target language and
a task-specific adapter module for the target task. This process enabled cross-lingual
transfer given a pretrained multilingual model. They were also able to demonstrate its efficacy
on languages unseen during the pretraining process.

The table below shows monolithic and modular techniques for each dimension of an
NLP problem.  Note that adapters still require a pretrained LM as its base, so
don't treat this as an either-or comparison.

| Dimension         | Monolithic                                                            | Modular                                                                  |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Multi-domain      | Most general-purpose BERT pretrained models                           | AdapterSoup (Chronopoulou et al., 2023), DEMix (Gurugangan et al., 2022) |
| Multi-task        | MT-DNN (Liu et al., 2019)                                             | AdapterFusion (Pfeiffer et al., 2021)                                    |
| Multi-lingual     | XLM-R (Conneau et al., 2019), Multilingual BERT (Devlin et al., 2018) | MAD-X (Pfeiffer et al., 2020), UNKs everywhere (Pfeiffer et al., 2021)   |

[^2]:

    NLP problems have multiple dimensions. Multi-domain: legal texts, finance
    documents, scientific publications, etc.; Multi-task: question answering,
    sequence classification, sequence tagging, etc.; Multi-lingual: English,
    German, French, etc.


There are still open problems I foresee with adapters. One is the
**complexity-efficiency tradeoff**.  It's possible to "go crazy" in architecting
adapters that the efficiency gain may not worth the complexity of the training
set-up. Just like in engineering, there's a tendency to go full-kubernetes when
you can just use a simple virtual machine. I'm curious about the practical
aspects of adapter training. I think [AdapterHub](https://adapterhub.ml/) is a
good start. I'm still looking forward to developments in this field.


### Prompt and prefix tuning: attach tunable parameters near the transformer input

Nowadays, the common way to leverage large-language models is through in-context
learning via *hard prompts* ([Brown et al., 2020](#brown2020incontext)). Take
this prompt, for example, in a text classification task:

```
Determine whether the text below is a "Recipe" or "Not a recipe"

Text: """Add 2 cups of rice to 3 cloves of garlic, then 
add butter to make fried rice"""
Answer: Recipe

Text: """I'm not sure if that will work"""
Answer: Not a recipe

Text: """To make a caesar salad, combine romaine lettuce, 
parmesan cheese, olive oil, and grated eggs"""
Answer:
```

We refer to the text above as a hard prompt because we're using actual tokens
that are not differentiable (think of "hard" as something static or set in
stone). The problem here is that the output of our LLM is highly-dependent on
how we constructed our prompt. Language is combinatorial: it will take a lot of
time to find the right "incantation" so that our LLM performs optimally. This
begs the question: what if we can learn our prompts?

> The problem [with in-context learning] is that the output of our LLM is
> highly-dependent on how we constructed our prompt.

Prompt and prefix tuning solves this by making use of **soft prompts**&mdash; a
vector attached to the input embedding that we train while keeping the
pretrained LM frozen. These two ideas appeared at the same time ([Lester et al,
2021](#lester2021prompt); [Li and Liang, 2021](#li2021prefix)) but have similar
mechanisms. The only difference is that prompt tuning adds the tensor only at
the input while prefix tuning adds the tensor at each transformer layer:

![](/assets/png/peft/encoder_with_prefix_tuning.png){:width="600px"}  
{:style="text-align: center;"}

```python
# Pseudocode of a typical encoder layer with soft prompts
class EncoderWithSoftPrompts:
    def __call__(self, x: Tensor, soft_prompt: Tensor) -> Tensor:
        soft_prompt = FeedForwardLayer(soft_prompt)
        x = concatenate([soft_prompt, x])
        residual = x
        x = MultiHeadAttention(x)
        x = LayerNorm(x + residual)
        residual = x
        x = FeedForwardLayers(x)
        x = LayerNorm(x + residual)
        return x
```

One of the currently popular implementations of prefix tuning is the
LLaMa-Adapter ([Zhang et al,. 2023](#zhang2023llamaadapter)). The mechanism is
similar to prefix tuning with some subtle differences:

- **Add prefix vectors only at the top-most layers**: just like in prefix tuning,
LLaMa adapter adds "adaption prompts" as prefix to the input instruction tokens.
However, these prompts are only added at the $$L$$ top-most transformer layers
unlike in [Li and Liang (2021)](#li2021prefix) (top-most: the first layers
affected by backpropagation).
- **Zero-init attention with gating**: here, the parameters near the attention
mechanism are initialized to zero instead of at random. This process avoids
unstable finetuning and "corruption" of LLaMa's original knowledge.

![](/assets/png/peft/encoder_llama.png){:width="700px"}  
{:style="text-align: center;"}

I find these techniques (collectively known as p*-tuning) exciting because they
open up different ways to update transformer inputs. I'm interested to examine,
post-hoc, the dependency of these soft prompt weights to the data or domain. For
example, we can probe these soft prompts to determine which parts of the input
were most influential in generating the output (for both autoregressive and
encoder-decoder networks). Lastly, I also find it exciting to seek ways to
aggregate soft prompts together for multilingual applications.

### LoRA: decompose transformer weight updates into lower-rank matrices

Lastly, [Hu et al.'s (2021)](#hu2021lora) work on Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)
aims to make the weight update process more efficient. Their premise, based from
[Aghajanyan et al. (2021)](#aghajanyan2021intrinsic), is that although weight
updates are of full-rank (each row and column are linearly-independent), they
can still be represented into a lower-dimensional space while retraining most
its structure (low-rank). 


This technique is akin to using PCA or UMAP to reduce an n-dimensional ($$n>2$$)
dataset into 2-d space in data visualization. In LoRA, we're reducing the weight
update matrix, $$\Delta W$$. Note that we're not really changing the shape of
$$\Delta W$$. Instead, we're representing it into a low-rank form where
redundancies are acceptable.

LoRA constrains the weight update $$\Delta W$$ of a matrix $$W_0 \in
\mathbb{R}^{d\times k}$$ with two trainable low-rank matrices $$A$$ and $$B$$.
This makes the weight update computation to be $$W_0 + \Delta W \rightarrow W_0 + BA$$, where $$B \in \mathbb{R}^{d\times r}$$ and $$A \in \mathbb{R}^{r \times
k}$$, $$r \ll min(d,k)$$:


![](/assets/png/peft/lora_matrices.png){:width="600px"}  
{:style="text-align: center;"}

These $$B$$ and $$A$$ matrices are trainable. They used a random Gaussian
initialization for $$A$$ and zero for $$B$$, so $$\Delta W$$ is a zero-matrix at
the beginning. Here, the rank $$r$$ is a hyperparameter that must be tuned. In a
transformer network, LoRA is applied to the attention weights:

![](/assets/png/peft/encoder_with_lora.png){:width="700px"}  
{:style="text-align: center;"}

I haven't seen a lot of works that expand on LoRA or rank-decomposition as an
efficient finetuning technique. However, I'm interested to perform more
empirical experiments on this method, especially on figuring out where else we
can attach these LoRA matrices. Interestingly, LoRA has found a foothold in 
image data, especially in diffusion networks ([Rombach et al.,
2021](#rombach2021diffusion)). Perhaps this technique can be extended into other
modes of data.

## Final thoughts

In this blog post, we looked into a few parameter-efficient finetuning
techniques (PEFTs) for large language models. First, we had adapters, that
attach small trainable modules between transformer layers. Then prompt and
prefix tuning, that attach tunable parameters near the transformer input.
Finally, we had low-rank adaptation that decompose transformer weights into
lower-rank matrices. 

It is interesting that despite their differences, there are structural
similarities. Recently, I've been interested in reading papers that surmise a
general framework for PEFTs. [He et al.'s (2021)](#he2021parallel) posits that
PEFTs can be seen as clever weight updates on a transformer subspace. [Pfeiffer
et al. (2023)](#pfeiffer2023modular) generalizes this further into what we now
know as modular deep learning. In the application side,
[AdapterHub](https://adapterhub.ml/) provides an implementation framework that
allows users to leverage these PEFTs.

> It is interesting that despite their differences, there are structural
> similarities between parameter-efficient finetuning techniques.

Finally, my interest in PEFTs are motivated by going against the current
zeitgeist in NLP: train larger and larger models with larger and larger
datasets. Perhaps there's value in moving the other way around. Moving the
needle in efficiency can lead to truly accessible and democratized NLP.
