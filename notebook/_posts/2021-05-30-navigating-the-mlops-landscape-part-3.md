<span class="firstcharacter">I</span>n the last section, we examined the MLOps
landscape by clustering them into four quadrants, each based on the nature of their
artifacts and scope in the ML lifecycle. By doing so, we arrived at the
following graph:

![](/assets/png/mlops-shop/ml-landscape-all.png){:width="640px"}  
{: style="text-align: center;"}

Here, I'll talk about strategies for integrating these tools into our
organization. I'll be using my own interpretation of the [Thoughtworks'
Technology Radar](https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar) and borrow familiar terms
such as *Adopt*, *Trial*, *Assess*, and *Hold*. Note that this will be a bit
opinionated, and your mileage may vary!

## Contents

To recap, this is a **three-part blogpost where I attempt to navigate the MLOps
landscape**. I'll be focusing on the commercial side, i.e., the tools,
startups, and frameworks that I've seen while I answer three key questions:

* [**Who/what will
    benefit?**](/notebook/2021/05/10/navigating-the-mlops-landscape): we'll set the stage
    by asking who will benefit by adopting these tools. Here, I'll introduce
    my version of the  ML lifecycle. 
* [**What do you want?**](#what-do-you-want): I'll describe a framework for 
   categorizing MLOps tools, and outline a specific adoption strategy for each group.
* [**What do I recommend?**](/notebook/2021/05/30/navigating-the-mlops-landscape-part-3): I'll list down some
    decision frameworks I recommend based from experience and research.

### Thoughtworks' Technology Radar

Before we jump in, I want to introduce Thoughtworks' Technology Radar. I first
saw it from [Neal Ford's
blogpost](http://nealford.com/memeagora/2013/05/28/build_your_own_technology_radar.html),
where he shared his organization's way of "being proactive in their
technology choices," and "objectively assessing technology uses in the wild." I
encourage you to read it, especially if you're a senior engineer or an IT lead. 

He breaks the radar down into four rings&mdash; Adopt, Trial, Assess, Hold:

![](/assets/png/mlops-shop/tech_radar.png){:width="350px"}  
*As you move towards the center, the need for adoption becomes stronger.*
{: style="text-align: center;"}

Below is a table that describes the appropriate strategy for each ring, and
example initiatives that can be done:


| Rings  | Strategy                                                        | Example Actions                                       |
|--------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| Adopt  | Use this tech if you don't want to get left behind. No-brainer  | Org-wide training, enforcement, adoption strategy     |
| Trial  | Pursue in a low-risk project or environment                     | Internal greenfield projects, small-scale work        |
| Assess | Explore and understand how it will affect you and your team    | Research projects, non client-facing work, dev spikes |
| Hold   | Don't bother for now, they are too new to reasonably assess yet | Lunchtime brownbags, attending conference sessions    |

Some observations:
* Similar to the [Gartner Hype Cycle](https://www.gartner.com/en/research/methodologies/gartner-hype-cycle), tools usually move from *Hold* to *Adopt*
    as engineers start to use it for real-world problems and uncover its
    limitations past the marketing fluff.
* A good litmus test for a tool to move from Assess to Trial is to use it in a
    fairly-sized project. 
* For tech that falls into the Hold category, Neal Ford mentions that "there's
    no harm in using it on existing projects," but think twice when using it
    for new ones.

Personally, I like writing a tech radar because it grounds me from [being too
distracted by the shiny new
object](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiny_object_syndrome). In addition, it
makes me aware of the technology bubbles I'm in. We'll be using the same
framework for the MLOps landscape.

## Technology Radar for MLOps

To cut to the case, here's my opinion on how to best adopt the MLOps landscape:


![](/assets/png/mlops-shop/tech_radar_landscape.png){:width="640px"}  
{: style="text-align: center;"}

<!-- initial observations -->

In the figure above, I partitioned the ML landscape from [Part
Two](/notebook/2021/05/15/navigating-the-mlops-landscape-part-2) into their
corresponding adoption strategy. Treat the four regions as *fuzzy*, they only
serve as rough guides on what best to do depending on where the tool falls
under. 

### Adopt

| Strategy | Type of Tools                                         | Description                                                          |
|-------|-------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Adopt | General Cloud Providers, Common SWE Stack, CI/CD Pipelines, Data Orchestrators | No-brainer. Build or plan capabilities on them as early as possible. |


This category includes tools I highly-recommend integrating into your org.
Note that decisions for adoption still depends on a variety of factors such as
price, team size, type of projects, and more. Nevertheless, it's still a good
option to consider them in your tech roadmap.

We see most software-engineering tools in the Adopt region. The usual suspects
like **Git, Docker, and Kubernetes**[^1] can be considered as "no-brainers."
They're almost the bread-and-butter of sofware development, that building
capabilities on them becomes paramount.

The same goes for [CI/CD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CI/CD) and
[ETL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extract,_transform,_load) tools. If you're
reading an MLOps article, chances are you're dealing with data. Pipelining
tools such as [Airflow](https://airflow.apache.org/) and
[Dagster](https://dagster.io/) should help **structure the ingress and egress**
of data from various sources. On the other hand, CI/CD tools improve your
overall development workflow.

Lastly, you'll find the top Cloud platforms under this category. Sure, you
might just need a [Heroku
instance](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/dyno-types) or a [DigitalOcean
droplet](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/droplets/),  but as your needs
grow, investing in a solid cloud platform is a viable strategy for
future-proofing your analytics toolkit. AWS, Azure, and GCP are sustainable
choices because it opens up a wide range of capabilities that you'll probably
need.

### Trial

| Strategy | Type of Tools                                                             | Description                                                                                                                                                |
|----------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Trial    | Vendor AI Platform, ML IaaS, Experiment Platforms  | Benefits outweigh risks. Be wary of limitations and non-breaking changes  |
| Trial    | Data Version Control, Single Component ML tools                           | Since scope is low, easy to plug-in and remove from your project if it doesn't suit your needs.                                                            |


This category of tools can be used in a mid-sized project while being mindful
of its risks. Most of the tools are new (2-3 years old), so they change their
APIs quite frequently. Nevertheless, they **offer more advanced capabilities in
the ML and Engineering domains**, that it's too good to pass up. My advice is
to test them out first in low-risk projects before adopting them as your daily
driver.

Vendor-based data science platforms such as
[Sagemaker](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/), [Google AI (now
Vertex)](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai), and [Azure
ML](https://studio.azureml.net/) are viable choices if you're already
subscribed to a cloud platform. Key benefit is less friction&mdash;you can just
think of these as additional services to your cloud stack. Their offerings
change too frequently (looking at you, Google), so just be careful with that.

If you wish to separate your data science workloads, then a Big Data or
ML-focused IaaS may be another option. In my opinion, most of these niche
platforms are more attuned to user pains than your cloud vendor. There are
tradeoffs, of course. If you rely on specialized cloud services like BigQuery,
Fargate, or Cloud Run, then it may be difficult to integrate, security notwithstanding.

Lastly, specialized ML tools are a must-try. Since their scope is "low" in the
ML lifecycle, it's less risky to replace them if it didn't work out. Moreover,
because they solve a single problem in your ML lifecycle
([DVC](https://dvc.org/) for versioning data, [Deepnote](https://deepnote.com/)
for notebooks, [Prodigy](https://prodi.gy/) for labelling), the benefits are
always clearer and more apparent.

### Assess

| Strategy | Type of Tools                                                    | Description                                                                                       |
|----------|------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Assess   | High-coverage SaaS, ML Project Frameworks, ML Task Orchestrators | Check feasibility on internal research projects. Assess age and community before trying them out. |

Most of the all-in-one machine learning platforms fall under this category. My
recommendation is to try them out in internal research projects, assessing how
it can affect your organization. The main difficulty for adopting these tools
is that they are a *hard-commit*: you need to follow their way of doing things to
reap long-term benefits.

Sometimes, it helps to follow the crowd. What I do to keep myself level-headed
with these technologies is to check-in with interest-groups such as [MLOps
Community](https://mlops.community/), [The
Sequence](https://thesequence.substack.com/), and [Kubernetes
SIG](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/README.md#governance).
Having a strong community behind the tech is beneficial.


Another signal I look for is *age*. Since MLOps is quite new, platforms that
are more than two years old is on top of my list. Moreso if a platform is
already being used by a large company and they're just open-sourcing it. A
"well-aged" tech ensures that it was battle-tested, and common bugs and kinks
have been ironed-out.

With that said, MLFlow, Kubeflow, and WandB are my top choices. All are backed
by a strong community, as they've already been used by alot of companies and
startups. Age also checks-out, with all of them hitting the 2-year old mark. 


### Hold

| Strategy | Type of Tools                             | Description                                                                                 |
|----------|-------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Hold     | No-code ML Platforms, Custom ML Platforms | Still in speculation. Don't bother for now, but useful to gather knowledge on what they do. |

If you have noticed from the graph, there are no tools left at this point.
However, the region where you need to hold-off adoption falls into the extremes of
all-in-one ML platforms. What kind of tools are in this edge? We can only
speculate:
* **No-code ML Platforms**: although I like the abstraction low-code platforms
    can bring, it's still too early to use them in production use-cases. I haven't
    seen alot of products in this space, but I can imagine something similar to
    [Google Teachables](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/).[^2] Perhaps,
    this set of tools cater to a new kind of persona.
* **Custom ML Platforms**: this set of tools can be industry specific, and has
    advanced capabilities for a particular application. Unfortunately, these
    may often be bespoke solutions that fail to generalize to your use-case.

So far, all of these things are still in speculation. Most of the newer MLOps
tools are often in the Assess or Trial stage, so it's still *safe* to try them
out.


## Build vs Buy

By the looks of it, it seems that I advocate for buying&mdash; and rightly so.
"Buy by default" is still my current stance.  In this section, I'll outline
cases when you should or should not build. 

* **Don't build if MLOps isn't your core business.** If you're
    in a large organization or consulting shop, then investing on build is
    useless. You'll be competing with startups that dedicate 100% of their
    resources on improving their MLOps product. It's way easier to just use
    what is available. 
* **Given that, build integrators and connectors.** Although I advise against building your
    own tool, I advocate for creating connectors between tools. Don't build
    your own ETL or annotation tool, but write a framework for connecting the
    two. It will be more fit to your business use-case.
* **Buy specialized ML tools first.** As mentioned in the [Trial](#trial)
    section, they are easier to plug in and out of your system. It also gives
    you a lot of opportunity to mix and match products that suit your
    organization's *existing* workflow.

These assertions are still falsifiable by counterexample.
[Kedro](https://github.com/quantumblacklabs/kedro), an ML project framework,
was built inside [QuantumBlack](https://www.quantumblack.com/), a consulting
shop. However, you can also see that [it's an integrator for Argo, Prefect,
Kubeflow, and more](https://github.com/quantumblacklabs/kedro#what-are-the-main-features-of-kedro). Again, treat these statements as a rule-of-thumb, not gospel truth.


## Conclusion

In the final part of this series, we applied Thoughtworks' Technology Radar to
our MLOps landscape. We categorized tools under Adopt, Trial, Assess, and Hold.
Most of the tools mentioned in [Part
Two](/notebook/2021/05/15/navigating-the-mlops-landscape-part-2) fell under the
first three categories, while we speculated on the final one.

Then, we looked into various cases of building and buying. In a few words, it's
better to buy by default if your core business is not about MLOps. However,
there's still value in creating integrators to glue all these products
together. With that said, I highly-recommend buying or trying specialized ML
tools first. 

That ends my three-part series no the MLOps landscape. Thank you again, reader,
for accompanying me in this journey! As I always say, I hope you enjoyed your
time here and learned something new. Feel free to drop a comment below if you
think that I misrepresented some of the tools above. There's too much, and
honestly it's really hard to keep up. Until next time!

### Footnotes

[^1]: I don't advocate using Kubernetes on every project. Sometimes you can do away with serverless options provided by your cloud provider (less debt). However, it may be important to build capabilities on this tech as you grow.
[^2]: Of course, Teachables isn't a machine learning platform. However, I imagine that the user-experience can be as seamless as this one in the future. At that point, it will even go beyond the standard lifecycle researchers and software engineers experience.
