  Sharing some lessons I learned in my brief journey in Haskell and functional programming. 
---

I've been studying Haskell on and off for almost two years now. Truth is,
I never got past the initial hump to be very productive in it. However, from
grad school to work life, Haskell's been like that low-maintenance friend
I say hi to occasionally and still managed to be exciting.

Last May, I had a breakthrough:








<!--
Introduction

In Thinking Machines, we track our time using X. However, I find that using
Toggl was actually cool. I export my Toggl checkins into a CSV, then run
chicken on top of it.

I've been studying Haskell on and off for three years now. 
By my own measure, I think chicken is the most successful Haskell project I've
done so far. I use it everyday, and it has been reliable for a long time

Seven Lessons
=============

- Life: Beginner's mindset
- Life: Ok to make small scoped projects that are useful
- Tech: In FP, you describe what you want to happen, like writing an equation
- Tech: It's ok to copy code and learn what it does later
- Tech: Functions should only do one thing and one thing well
- Life: Build things, even if the only audience is you
- Tech: It's ok to stop

What's next?
I may have paused learning Haskell, but it doesn't mean that I stopped learning
functional programming. I'm currently dipping my toes on Elixir, and see myself
building small web-apps on that. 

I also appreciate types. This led me to put type annotations in Python (they're
like documentation, and much better if you add mypy). Also made me like
Pydantic.
