[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ljvmiranda921/ljvmiranda921.github.io.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ljvmiranda921/ljvmiranda921.github.io) 

The build script can be found on `./script/cibuild`. It runs the `html-proofer`
gem which checks for inconsistencies in the generated page. Whenever you want
to create a new post, or develop the site, always make a Pull Request so that
the proofer can investigate the changes you've made.
