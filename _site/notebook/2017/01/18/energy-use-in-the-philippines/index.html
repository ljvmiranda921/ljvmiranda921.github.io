<h2 id="access-to-electricity">Access to electricity</h2>
<p>The charts below show the percentage of the urban and rural population with access to electricity and the comparison of the country’s performance with its neighbor south-east Asian nations.</p>

<h3 id="access-to-electricity-over-time">Access to electricity over time</h3>

<p><img src="/assets/png/eda-energy/output_6_1.png" alt="Access to electricity over time" /></p>

<p>The chart above shows the population’s access to electricity over a period of 20 years. Although there was a sharp division of resources in the 90s, access to this need is being
resolved as time progresses. It is commendable that the government (as well as the private companies)
has started putting effort to provide electricity to rural communities at the onset of the millenium.</p>

<p>It is also interesting to note that the years with a steeper slope started in 2010, and this can be
credited to the previous administration (and the corresponding electricity conglomerates) for continuing
the steep rise done in the previous years.</p>

<h3 id="sea-comparison">SEA Comparison</h3>

<p><img src="/assets/png/eda-energy/output_9_1.png" alt="SEA Comparison" /></p>

<p>One can observe that both Philippines and Indonesia started out similarly in the 90s,
yet because of the steepness of Indonesia’s slope in the chart, it was able to follow the
leading countries—even overtaking Thailand in the year 2000.
However, it may also be important to investigate the state of these countries before
1990s in order to see how this progression came to be.</p>

<p>Top-performing countries in achieving the goal of universal access to electricity are
Singapore, Malaysia, and Thailand. Achieving almost a 100% by the turn of 2012. Singapore,
on the other hand, is a consistent performer, allowing its population to have access to
electricity for 20 years.</p>

<h2 id="energy-mix">Energy Mix</h2>

<p>Equally important in understanding the country’s energy use is to know where our energy is being
sourced from. This section will look into the different sources of energy—fossil fuels (coal,
natural gas, petroleum), hydroelectric, and renewable in order to gain insight to where most of our
electricity is coming from.</p>

<p>Moreover, a comparison with the SEA top-performers (in terms of providing electricity access)
will be done in order to assess where the huge bulk of the electricity\textemdash that they are
sourcing effectively to the population—is coming from.</p>

<p>Lastly, it is also important to investigate the country’s adoption to renewable energy,
and compare this with our SEA neighbors. This can help identify trends, especially that using
fossil fuels contributes much to our carbon footprint—given the devastating results of
global warming and climate change.</p>

<h3 id="energy-mix-in-the-philippines">Energy Mix in the Philippines</h3>

<p><img src="/assets/png/eda-energy/output_13_1.png" alt="Energy Mix in the Philippines-1" /></p>

<p><img src="/assets/png/eda-energy/output_14_1.png" alt="Energy Mix in the Philippines-2" /></p>

<p>It is evident that the country is still reliant to fossil fuels as a main source of energy.
Hydroelectric easily caught up and is a stable source to the fifth of our energy supply in the country.
Interestingly, the contribution of renewable energy in the country is comparable to that of
hydroelectric— and by combining the two together, one can see that these “clean” sources of
energy contributes more than a fourth of our total energy mix.</p>

<p>Looking at the country’s fossil fuel mix, one can see that our use of petroleum has significantly
dropped for the last 20 years. This has been replaced by other fossil fuels such as natural gas
(during the 1980s) and coal (during the 2000s).</p>

<h3 id="comparison-to-sea-neighbors">Comparison to SEA Neighbors</h3>
<p>This section looks into the position of the Philippines with respect to the
use of fossil fuels and the adoption of renewable energy through time.</p>

<h4 id="fossil-fuel-use">Fossil Fuel Use</h4>

<p><img src="/assets/png/eda-energy/output_18_0.png" alt="Fossil Fuel Use" /></p>

<p>The use of fossil fuel in the energy mix is shown in the figure above. It is interesting
that the top-players in providing access to electricity in their respective
population—Singapore, Thailand, and Malaysia—are sourcing their energy
mostly from fossil fuels.</p>

<p>The Philippines, on the other hand, is fourth from below in the level of fossil fuel that constitutes the energy mix. The first in this list is Myanmar, where fossil fuel constitutes 20 to 40% of the energy mix.</p>

<h4 id="renewable-energy-adoption">Renewable Energy Adoption</h4>

<p><img src="/assets/png/eda-energy/output_21_1.png" alt="Renewable Energy Adoption" /></p>

<p>The figure above shows the renewable energy adoption of different SEA
countries over time. It is interesting to note that the Philippines is leading
the renewable energy race, then followed by Indonesia and the rest of the
SEA countries.</p>

<h2 id="energy-consumption">Energy Consumption</h2>
<p>With the knowledge of the country’s energy sources, the next step is to un-
derstand how we consume that energy. This section will first look into the
country’s electric power consumption over time, then look at our consump-
tion footprint—particularly that of carbon emissions and other greenhouse
gases.</p>

<h3 id="electric-power-consumption-over-time">Electric power consumption over time</h3>

<p><img src="/assets/png/eda-energy/output_25_1.png" alt="Electric Power Consumption over time" /></p>

<p>It can be observed from the chart above that the power consumption
in the country has increased from about 200 kWh to 700 kWh over time.
It is expected that this consumption will increase, and this corresponds to
unprecedented effects in our environment; as we continue utilizing different
sources for our electricity use.</p>

<h3 id="consumption-footprint">Consumption footprint</h3>

<p><img src="/assets/png/eda-energy/output_28_1.png" alt="Consumption footprint" /></p>

<p>These unprecedented effects are what we often call as our consumption foot-
print, for it leaves traces in nature that we may not expect. This section will
look into our carbon footprint and different greenhouse gases, taken mainly
from our use of fossil fuels as energy source, and through our continued
consumption of electricity (managed or not).</p>

<p>Similar to the rise of our electric consumption, our carbon footprint has
increased steadily for the last few years. Different sources have contributed
to this, the first mainly by liquid fuel, then followed by solid fuel and then
by gaseous fuel. It is expected that this trend will continue to rise, and its
effects might be felt if left unmitigated.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>This report looks into World Bank’s World Development Indicators in order
to understand the energy situation in the Philippines. Three aspects were
considered|the access to electricity of the population, the energy mix, and
the energy consumption and footprint.</p>

<p>The country’s access to electricity is being resolved through time, increasing the
rural population’s access for the last twenty years. However,
much work is to be done, for the country is only 6th compared to its SEA
neighbors in this category. However, much can be said in the country’s energy mix,
for the use of fossil fuels (although still in majority) is being
offset by hydroelectric and renewable sources of energy. In fact, the country
is leading among its SEA neighbors with respect to the renewable energy
adoption. Lastly, the electricity consumption of the country is still on the
rise, and will still be, given the trend for the last twenty years. This can
then be followed by an increasing carbon footprint, which may lead to unprecedented effects if left unmitigated.</p>
