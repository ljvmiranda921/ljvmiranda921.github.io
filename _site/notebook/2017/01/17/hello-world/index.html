!</p>

<p>Anyway, welcome to my blog!</p>

<p>I am Lester James V. Miranda, a twenty-something aspiring engineer from Quezon City, Philippines. I finished a degree in Electronics Engineering 
(minoring in Philosophy) from Ateneo de Manila University. Right now, I’m taking graduate studies in Waseda University in Japan.</p>

<p>I fell in love with engineering at a very young age, I wired my first circuit when I was 10, and built my first database program in Visual Basic 
when I was 14 (and I didn’t stop ever since!). I also love reading books! My favorites authors are Neil Gaiman, Gabriel Garcia Marquez and Haruki Murakami. Moreover, my bookshelf is 
also filled with Filipino Literature— from the poem collections of Jose Garcia Villa up to the Trese komiks of Budjette Tan— I am truly your classic geek!</p>

<p>I built this site because I realized that I have done a lot of projects in the past (from open source to the ones required in my classes) 
but I wasn’t able to document all of them into something that is readable by anyone. I also want to reach the programming community, 
for there are lot of things that I wanted to share, and I hope that by writing about my projects (or showing my code), I’ll be able 
to trade knowledge with everyone!</p>

<p>I know that there are still a LOT of things that I have to learn. As of this moment, I am so interested in machine learning, 
data science, Raspberry Pi, and web development! I will be writing more about these (and anything in between!).</p>
