    <div class="abstract">Predicting protein functions using machine learning techniques is a major challenge in bioinformatics. Previous works address this problem by directly feeding raw data in a classifier. However, feature-space interdependence is underused, and interesting structure in the data may be left underutilized. In addition, constructing features manually is tedious and time-consuming. In this research, a stacked denoising autoencoder was implemented to extract new features automatically before classification. A gene annotation pipeline, consisting of the autoencoder and a multi-label support-vector machine, is proposed. It was tested on benchmark datasets, including the A. thaliana specie, and showed significant improvements in various metrics. This research demonstrates that adding an unsupervised phase before classification can aid in the multi-label learning of protein functions.</div>

    <div class="abstract">An autoencoder is often used to extract features from raw data. However, given the goal of reconstructing the input, they tend to greedily create features to satisfy the objective–without concern whether the features were relevant or not. A Reallocative k-Sparse Autoencoder (RSAE) is proposed to automatically select features before reconstruction. After the feedforward phase, a competitive layer where each hidden unit’s energy will be computed. The k% highest units will then be reallocated with the energy (controlled by a parameter α ) of the non-k units, as the latter’s activation is set to 0. This scheme ensures the extraction of sparse and important features that can be used for classification or network pre-training.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Power management systems employ appliance recognition such that the burden of manually configuring the system for each appliance is lifted from the user. This research then aims to develop an appliance recognition functionality through current readings gathered from a data acquisition (DAQ) device consisting of Hall Effect current sensors, and through a machine learning classification algorithm called k-nearest neighbors. Ten appliances were tested, comprising of 6,500 samples of test data in the four outlets tested. The average accuracy for the trials is 92.73%. In addition, the appliance recognition functionality was embedded to a cloud-based power management system following an Internet of Things (IoT) architecture. In the end, the developed system can gather data from plugged appliances, perform recognition, and carry out various power management functionalities such as monitoring and appliance–level smart–recommendations.</div>

    <img class="thumbnail" src="/assets/jpg/thumbs/envi-ethics.pdf.jpg" alt="Publication thumbnail" />
    <div class="abstract">The Calauit Safari Island Park is a classic case of tampering with biodiversity, with the introduction of non-native fauna and the expulsion of the Tagbanuas as stewards of the land. Three major themes will be discussed in this paper. First of which is the overlaying theme of biodiversity. The paper will tackle what it means to have greater diversity; and its impact in ecological processes and in maintaining a state of balance and justice. The second theme will discuss intrinsic value, following the notion that entities—whether species, individuals, or things have an innate worth—regardless of human benefits. Lastly, this framework will be applied to discuss sustainable eco-tourism, especially to the management of zoos, sanctuaries, dive spots and the like, where there is significant human intervention in natural areas. The case of Calauit will be analyzed in parallel with these three themes, and a short reflection will be provided at the end.</div>
