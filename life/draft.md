### The Mechanics is the message

Earlier, I mentioned that the genius of Celeste's gameplay is in its ability to
make me empathize with Madeline's struggles as she scales the
Mountain&mdash;which, as we've seen in the first section, was communicated
through its story. Here, I'll discuss how it was achieved through
Celeste's precision-platformer mechanics, particularly, (1) by focusing on
player creativity, and (2) its forgiveness & patience.

Before we start, I'd like to talk about how difficult Celeste is! I mean, look
at this screen:

<!-- show a difficult screen from Chapter 3 -->

Environmental hazards are scattered all throughout: spikes litter floors and
walls, objects kill you at a slightest touch, strong winds hinder your
movement, and much more! Add this to the fact that I haven't played platformer
games in a while, so it's no surprise that even the canon storyline is more
challenging than it should be.

<!-- I died in the prologue -->


Madeline's controls are also limited: she can only jump, climb walls, and
dash&mdash; nothing more. There are no items, *souls* to collect, nor magic.
Her mechanics emphasize the importance of **player skill** in solving the
platforming puzzles. Given this small moveset, clearing a screen may require
combining these movements to perform acrobatic maneuvers, or taking advantage
of the environment along her way.

<!-- just get a GIF from a speed run -->

This brings us to my first reflection point: **the success of Madeline is in my
[our] hands**.  Her wins are my wins, and so are her deaths. It's not because
of a magic item or an overpowered stat boost that will make me zoom across the
screen. More importantly, puzzles can be cleared in more ways than one: I find
it fascinating to watch speedrunners clear screens in ways I never imagined.
This removes the "memorization mechanic" where you just need to perform certain
button-presses and you're done. Sure it's constrained, but it's flexible enough
to endow some personal touch in completing these puzzles. In other words,
constraints conceive creativity.

> Constraints conceive creativity

Before, I saw my anxiety as a constraint or weakness&mdash; I worry a lot and
think about things in the future. At first I thought of it as limiting and
crippling, especially given the insurmountable Mountain called Life that I need
to face.  However, as with Madeline's jump, climb, or dash, *constraints
conceive creativity.*[^4] I slowly learned to lean-in to this "weakness." For
example, it made me more confident in my planning skills:[^5] I can anticipate
potential paths where things might go wrong, break down vague objectives into
clearer ones, and so on.  Sure, **it's still difficult**, but just like any of
Celeste's platforming puzzles, I know I can clear it given my limited moveset.

<!-- Forgiveness and Patience -->

Celeste is self-aware of its difficulty. A key giveaway is the death counter
prominently shown at the end of each level, and some notes such as:

<!-- Insert postcard about not worrying about your death counter -->

In some ways, the ideas of Celeste fit precisely in a platformer game: it's
about trying over and over again, while overcoming the urge to give up.
However, what differentiates Celeste from similar games is its **forgiveness
and patience**. Sure, there's no health bar, and one tiny mistake kills you, but
death doesn't punish you so hard: instead of repeating the whole chapter, you
immediately start at the last screen you've been to. In addition, resurrection
is quick, Madeline just goes into a Megaman-like poof, and you're back again. 

This differs in some of the platformers I tried (in the course of writing this
post) like [*Super Meat
Boy*](https://store.steampowered.com/app/40800/Super_Meat_Boy/) or [*Dead
Cells*](https://store.steampowered.com/app/588650/Dead_Cells/),[^6] where there is
an element of rage and spite that motivates you to complete a level. Instead,
Celeste the game cheers for you and wishes for you to succeed. Inasmuch as Celeste
is self-aware of its difficulty, it's also self-aware that it isn't
impossible&mdash; you just gotta keep trying.[^7]

In addition, the game is patient in introducing one mechanic after the other.
In the first chapter, it "teaches" you the concept of springs and spikes, then
later on you'll encounter a moving platform, and near the end you'll see a
combination of these mechanics. This "narrative" is done for each chapter, and
in a macro-level, throughout the game.[^8] If, for some instance, I skipped screens
and went to the latter parts of the game, I'd definitely feel intimidated once
I see those spike-covered floors, moving dust-bunnies, and strong winds in one
screen. However, because the game has patiently taught me its mechanics as I
progress, I instead find them more manageable.

In the end, Celeste's mechanics allows the player to experience Madeline's
struggles throughout the game, while being forgiving and patient about
it. It's wonderfully-tight, given that the last power-up is simply a
double-dash, not some grand zooming ability. The game's final ascent is still
difficult, but it says something: **overcoming anxiety and depression is a
process**&mdash; catharsis is important but it doesn't end there. 

The final level is wonderful because it reminds you of how far you've come.
There will be multiple callbacks to all of the previous chapters' gimmicks, but
this time it feels more doable&mdash; like looking back at top of the
mountain you just climbed. It's all because you failed, you learned, and you
tried again. 

### Story in Sounds

In the last two sections, we saw how the narrative and gameplay mechanics
dovetail to form a tight and cohesive experience, enabling me to share with
Madeline's struggles. Those two alone already makes Celeste a wonderful game,
but the masterful way it uses its soundtrack to heighten our experiences brings
this platformer into greater heights.

A major element of Celeste's composition is its use of *leitmotif*, a recurring
musical phrase that represents a theme or idea. In the game, this occured both
in (1) the melody, and (2) the characters' "instruments". Note that I will only
touch specific aspects of the soundtrack in this post, there's definitely a lot
that can be written on the game's OST and I'd happily recommend some works that
explored various aspects of Celeste's music.

The first few minutes of the game introduce us to two recurring
melodies: the sound of struggle in the *Prologue*, and the main theme in *First
Steps*. 

I'm hesitant to label *Prologue*'s melody as a motif because its callback only
happens at the end of the game. When we first encounter it, we're
in the middle of escaping a crumbling bridge. The fast tempo denotes the idea
of the struggle, the intensity increases, then it ends with a falling sound.

The *Prologue*'s music is memorable because my experience with it is unique.
After I completed the game and joined Celeste's subreddit, I learned that the
tutorial bird should teach you the dash mechanic as you're falling right away.
In my case, I fell (and laughably died) twice before the tutorial bird showed
up.[^9] Coupled with the falling sound, this experience cemented the idea that
this game is **really** hard. Deep in my subconscious, those exact notes and
descending tone ingrained the feeling of failure amidst the struggle. 

<!-- GIF of crumbling bridge -->

I want you to keep this tone in mind, because its callback later on is
satisfying. Moving on, let's head over one of the most apparent melodies
throughout the game.

The first level&mdash;and coincidentally its soundtrack, *First Steps*&mdash;
introduces us to the main theme:

<!-- Insert sheet music -->

I'd daresay that this could even be Madeline's theme, for we hear this in
crucial points of her climb. In the beginning, her theme evokes a sense of
wonder and exploration. We (the player) only know about the climb, but none of
the emotional undertone Madeline experiences. The atmosphere is blissful and
the song's overall arc is rousing: the initial clap-like beats (0:04) hype us
up, and the synth-like beats in the music's second phase  (starting at 1:04)
reminds us the difficulty of our ascent. It is challenging yet
promising, chock-full of determination that perfectly describes our main
character.

> [Madeline's theme] is challenging yet promising, chock-full of determination
> that perfectly describes our main character.

Madeline's theme finds us back in *Madeline and Theo*, after she experienced
all major challenges on her way up: being chased by her dark doppelgangers,
a difficulty spike in Chapter 3, a boss sequence with a ghastly concierge, a
panic-attack, and so on. *Madeline and Theo* is played during a heartwarming
scene with Theo, their campfire alit, sharing stories about their life. Because
the last time we heard her theme was in *First Steps*, the callback on this
scene evokes newfound determination, but this time, aware of the struggle
the Mountain possesses.

Character instruments also played a huge role in this scene. As a player, I
know by now that Madeline is represented by the piano, and Theo by the guitar.
In *Madeline and Theo*, our protagonist is not alone (and perhaps this is the
first song where Madeline's piano is played with another instrument). She is
accompanied by a guitar, and they play her theme in a harmonious fashion.

It is also noteworthy that *Starjump* comes after this song. It is a perfect
interlude that gives a more heightened feeling of overcoming diffifulties along
our way.

Determination comes into play again in *Confronting Myself*, at the final "boss
battle." Madeline is determined to reach into Badeline, resulting into a
"reverse chase sequence" where we're the one running after Badeline and she's
the one running away from us (while shooting lasers and deathly orbs along our
way). In-game, this arc was very long, testing the player's patience and mettle
all throughout.

We also hear the synth, representing Badeline, throughout the game. It tries to
overpower Madeline's theme (and her instrument), in a goth-like chiptune
fashion. Perfectly apt for a boss battle.

Remember *Prologue*? Its frantic melody will reappear again in *Reach for the
Summit*, during the final ascent. Because my previous experience taught me that
this song is about failure (because oh boy, I died twice in the Prologue), I
got intimidated when I heard its initial notes, especially during the summit
run. As the notes race, I'm starting to doubt if I can actually finish this game...

But something changed, listen to the transition in 0:50 to 0:87. Compare this
with the original *Prologue* on the 0:42 mark.

<!-- Link to youtube video -->

There's no more falling tone! It's a subtle difference, but it was replaced by
something more heroic (the rhythm even reminds me of the Avengers theme). It
seems to tell me: "Yes, this is going to be difficult, but this time around,
you can do this." 

<!-- You can do this -->

...and then it transitions to Madeline's theme. She has found her bearings and
begins the climb. 

<!-- Link to youtube video -->

<!-- Reach for the summit poster? -->

In the final leg of the Summit, during the 3000-m mark and where the
checkpoints appear, the *Prologue*'s melody comes up again. Like the last time, it
doesn't end with a falling tone but a heroic one. But what you hear next is
powerful:


<!-- Link to youtube video: final part of the summit -->

*Madeline's theme* plays, but it is now a combination of the Piano and the
Synth, singing in a harmonious fashion. During this part, everything
coincides perfectly: the narrative tells us how Madeline works with her
anxiety and depression through Badeline, the mechanic grants us the double-dash
power-up, a product of Madeline and Badeline's fusion, and the music gives us 
a high-beat, perfect symphony of Madeline and Badeline's instruments&mdash;
all combined to pack the perfect gameplay experience of a lifetime.


## Conclusion: Heart of the Mountain

<!-- crafted to illicit the same emotions that Madeline experiences throughout
the game -->
<!-- share with her catharsis -->

[^4]: A bit off-topic, but this learning, *constraints conceive creativity* made me drawn to pixel art. In Pixel Art, you're mostly working on a small canvass, and it "forces" you to creatively represent small details in low-resolution.

[^8]: The creators of Celeste [conducted a workshop in GDC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RlpMhBKNr0) (Games Developers Conference) about the game's level-design. It's definitely worth a watch if you have half an hour to spare! Very insightful and it shows the level of craftsmanship Matt and his team does.
