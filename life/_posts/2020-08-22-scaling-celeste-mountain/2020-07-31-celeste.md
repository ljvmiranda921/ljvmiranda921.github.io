**Prologue:** I've never been into video games when I was young.[^1] It didn't
occur to me that they can be subjects for serious thought or reflection.
However, the lockdowns forced me to find ways to fill my weekends without
programming; so I downloaded Steam, purchased my first few games &mdash;
*Terraria*, *Stardew Valley*, *Celeste* &mdash; and made the jump.[^2]


## Introduction: the First Steps


[Celeste](http://www.celestegame.com/) is a charming platformer where you play
a character named Madeline, a young woman dead-set on climbing the top of the
titular Mountain.  Along the way she'll meet new friends, deal with her inner
demons, and survive the hazards beset her trail.

{: style="text-align: center;"}


Sure, it's *just* a game about climbing a mountain, but it triumphs by pulling
me in to the struggles of Madeline, and connecting it to my own experiences
without feeling forced at all. Celeste was able to achieve this with its (1)
masterful storytelling, (2) tight mechanics and gameplay, and (3) genius use of
music. By seeing how these three were weaved together into a singular
*experience*, I developed a profound appreciation for video games as a medium
and saw its potential for creative expression.

I decided to break this post into a three-part series: 
* **Part I: Introduction and Storytelling (this page)**: I'll introduce
    Celeste the game, and talk about how its strong narrative has drawn me into
    completing it. 
* [**Part II: Mechanics is the Message, Story in Sounds** (August 15)](/life/2020/08/15/celeste-part-2): I'll talk about how
    Celeste's precision-platformer mechanics and masterful soundtrack contributed to the storyline and
    enriched the gameplay and experience even further.
* [**Part III: Conclusion** (August 22)](/life/2020/08/22/celeste-part-3): in the final part of this series,
    I'll end with a short Conclusion and reflection on Celeste overall, how it
    changed my perception on video games, and more.

<b>Spoiler Warning!</b><br>
This review will contain a lot of spoilers in Celeste the game. If you haven't played the game, try it out first then come back later!</p>


## Reach for the Summit

For the next three sections, I'll discuss how the narrative, mechanics, and
music reinforce one another to form a cohesive experience.  This
interplay made the game stand-out: nothing feels shoehorned-in, everything fits
perfectly like a platforming puzzle.


> Nothing feels shoehorned-in, everything fits perfectly like a platforming

### Masterful storytelling

Celeste's story is simple yet packed with an emotional undertone: Madeline, our
protagonist, wants to reach the peak of Celeste mountain. What makes it
masterful is on how it was able to make me empathize with Madeline, both
in-game and in real-life. 


It has a light-hearted exterior: I personally enjoy meeting the quirky
side-characters with their silly, gibberish, and garbled voices:

<!-- Video clip of funny convo scene: YOLOOO -->
<p align="center"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gX0JCVgfAYU" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>  
**Clip**: If those gibberish voices didn't charm you, I don't know what will
{: style="text-align: center;"}


However, behind this cheerful backdrop lies a tale about anxiety, depression,
and the difficulties of modern life. Madeline suffers from panic-attacks,
drinks, and gets stressed. In one of the early sequences of the game, she
encounters Badeline, her dark alternate, who serves as a physical manifestation
of her fears and anxieties. From that moment forward, Badeline will taunt and
chase me, culminating in an epic boss battle in Celeste's penultimate chapter.

![](/assets/png/celeste/badeline_chase_scene_ch2.gif){:width="560px"}  
**Run for your life**: One of the earlier Badeline chase scenes in
Chapter 2 
{: style="text-align: center;"}

Her motivation for the climb, "to overcome and accomplish *something*," wasn't
made explicit. I believe it was intentional so that we can project
our own goals and struggles as we play the game&mdash; and this is
where its genius lies:

> Inasmuch as she [Madeline] wants to conquer Celeste the Mountain,
> metaphorically representing her life's insurmountable challenges, I also want
> to conquer Celeste the game, and perhaps my life's insurmountable challenges
> too.

<!-- Madeline quote scene -->

![](/assets/png/celeste/why_climb_2.jpg){:width="560px"}  
**Why Climb the Mountain?**: Madeline's motivation wasn't made explicit so that we can project our own goals and struggles as we play the game.
{: style="text-align: center;"}


I empathize with Madeline because inasmuch as she wants to conquer Celeste the
Mountain, metaphorically representing her life's insurmountable challenges, I
also want to conquer Celeste the game, and perhaps my life's insurmountable
challenges too. This two-fold interplay between in-game and real-life
experience helped propel the story forward. In some ways, I *am* Madeline; not
only because I play her character (her deaths and successes are my own), but
also because I experience her struggles and motivations. Her story does not end
even after I close the game or beat it. It continues to exist and grips me in
this reality.

<!-- treating the subject delicately -->
Another thing that I like about Celeste's storytelling is on how it treated its
subject-matter delicately. It approached the topics of anxiety and depression with
kindness&mdash; not with an overly-pedantic tone. Acknowledging the innate
difficulty of precision-platformers, its message in the prologue is full of
hope: *"You can do this."*

![](/assets/png/celeste/you_can_do_this.jpg){:width="560px"}  
**A message of hope**: One of the earlier messages you'll see as you play the
game.
{: style="text-align: center;"}

It never said "Hey, just talk to your friends!" or "Just do some meditation!"
Instead, it presents you a heartwarming conversation with Theo, and a mini-game
about a golden feather.[^3] The latter was particularly special because it caught me
off-guard: it serves a perfect blend of gameplay, storytelling, and emotion on the
experience of panic-attacks.

![](/assets/png/celeste/golden_feather_1.jpg){:width="560px"}
![](/assets/png/celeste/golden_feather_2.jpg){:width="560px"}  
**Stay afloat**: A highly-emotional scene introduces the golden feather
mini-game&mdash; a breathing exercise that I still do today.
{: style="text-align: center;"}


Because of that, the "conclusion" of Madeline's struggle is very well-earned. At
the start of Chapter 6, just a few more distance to the summit, she will
fall back to the start and is again confronted by her dark side:

![](/assets/png/celeste/falling.jpg){:width="560px"}  
**Quiet and Falling**: At the penultimate chapter, Madeline will fall back to
the base of the Mountain.
{: style="text-align: center;"}

By the end of its penultimate chapter (and again, after an epic boss chase
sequence), Madeline realizes that instead of running away from Badeline, who
represents her fears and anxieties, she must **learn how to work and function
with her.** Overcoming depression is not about *defeating it*, it's a Part of
Me that I need to accept and embrace. 

It's also noteworthy that "Badeline" isn't the in-game (or official) name of
Madeline's doppelganger. It's merely born from the gaming community's need for
shorter names. In-game, she's only referred to as a Part of Me/You. In my
opinion, this helps because we avoid labelling this Part of Us as "bad." I
think that without this pre-judgment, we can be more comfortable embracing it,
the same way Madeline did.


![](/assets/png/celeste/madeline_badeline-hug.jpg){:width="560px"}  
**Acceptance**: Madeline and Badeline share a hug
{: style="text-align: center;"}

Upon this realization, Madeline and this Part of Her will fuse, granting us the
ability to double-dash, for the final chapter to reach the summit. 

![](/assets/png/celeste/fuse.webp){:width="560px"}
{: style="text-align: center;"}

The climb towards the summit isn't easy, even with the double-dash power-up (it's a
culmination of all previous chapters' environmental mechanics made
difficult). However, the journey towards the summit shows that **dealing with
one's depression is a process**: we see Madeline and this Part of Her converse with
one another, and work towards their differences as they traverse through the
Mountain.

![](/assets/png/celeste/converse.jpg){:width="560px"}
{: style="text-align: center;"}

Celeste's storytelling is masterful because it enables us to empathize with the
main character's struggles, and it continues to live outside the game.
Madeline and I share the same struggles&mdash;both in a platforming and
real-life sense&mdash;and by extension, her successes and failures are also my
own. Upon reaching the Summit, we're shown a picture of Madeline staring over
the horizon. I leaned back to my chair, took in the view, and felt a sense of
elation and joy upon realizing what we've accomplished.

In the [next section](/life/2020/08/22/celeste-part-2/), we'll see how this
tight storyline was made more vibrant by weaving it through its intricate
gameplay and solid mechanics.  Remember, Celeste is not a Telltale Adventure
game where you just click conversational cues, it's a hard-platformer that
demands creative problem-solving and precise inputs to overcome immense
difficulties.


### Next Sections

* [**Part II: Mechanics is the Message, Story in Sounds** (August 15)](/life/2020/08/15/celeste-part-2/): I'll talk about how
    Celeste's precision-platformer mechanics and masterful soundtrack contributed to the storyline and
    enriched the gameplay and experience even further.
* [**Part III: Conclusion** (August 22)](/life/2020/08/22/celeste-part-3/): in the final part of this series,
    I'll end with a short Conclusion and reflection on Celeste overall, how it
    changed my perception on video games, and more.


### Footnotes

[^1]: The last console I had was a PSOne (the big boxy version) from my uncle, and a Gameboy SP back in grade school. I did play some games casually (Final Fantasy Tactics Advance, and Pokemon Sapphire comes to mind), but not with a deeper appreciation that I have today.
[^2]: I still do some open-source work such as answering Issues and reviewing PRs, but sometimes you just want to take a break! The last open-source project I did was [Sprites-as-a-Service](/sprites-as-a-service), go check it out!
[^3]: I later learned that the golden feather minigame was based from an actual [floating feather meditation technique](http://davidvago.bwh.harvard.edu/the-floating-feather-meditation-technique/). Someone replicated the [mini-game](https://github.com/FdelMazo/Feather) that you can try out (although I believe the experience will be more complete if you played the game)!
