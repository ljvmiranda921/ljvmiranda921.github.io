> Celeste is one of the most memorable games I've played this year. A
> brilliant masterpiece, it developed in me a profound appreciation of games
> as a vehicle for creative expression. Read more about my journey in scaling
> Celeste Mountain in this three-part series.

In the [first section](/life/2020/07/31/celeste/), we looked into how Celeste's
storytelling was executed by enabling the player to share with Madeline's
struggles in a plot-focused perspective. In this section, we'll look into how
it was achieved by combining both gameplay and musical elements into the
narrative, drawing me closer to Madeline's journey.

I decided to break this post into a three-part series: 
* [**Part I: Introduction and Storytelling**](/life/2020/07/31/celeste/): I'll introduce
    Celeste the game, and talk about how its strong narrative has drawn me into
    completing it. 
* **Part II: Mechanics is the Message, Story in Sounds** (this page): I'll talk about how
    Celeste's precision-platformer mechanics and masterful soundtrack contributed to the storyline and
    enriched the gameplay and experience even further.
* [**Part III: Conclusion** (August 22)](/life/2020/08/22/celeste-part-3/): in the final part of this series,
    I'll end with a short Conclusion and reflection on Celeste overall, how it
    changed my perception on video games, and more.


<p style="border:3px; border-style:solid; border-color:#FF0000; padding: 1em;">
<b>Spoiler Warning!</b><br>
This review will contain a lot of spoilers in Celeste the game. If you haven't played the game, try it out first then come back later!</p>


## The Mechanics is the message

Earlier, I mentioned that the genius of Celeste's gameplay is in its ability to
help me empathize with Madeline's struggles as she scales the
Mountain&mdash;which, as we've seen in the first section, was communicated
through its story. Here, I'll discuss how it was achieved through
Celeste's precision-platformer mechanics, particularly, (1) by focusing on
player creativity, and (2) its forgiveness & patience.

Before we start, I'd like to talk about how difficult Celeste is! I mean, look
at this screen:

<!-- show a difficult screen from Chapter 3 -->
![](/assets/png/celeste/difficult_screen.webp){:width="560px"}  
**Dust Bunnies**: Players like me will encounter a difficulty spike in Chapter 3. On this screen, I'm not allowed to touch the black blobs. Moreover, touching a floor or wall once will generate new blobs, preventing me to backtrack.
{: style="text-align: center;"}

Environmental hazards are scattered all throughout: spikes litter floors and
walls, objects kill you at a slightest touch, strong winds hinder your
movement, and much more! Add this to the fact that I haven't played platformer
games in a while, so it's no surprise that even the canon storyline is more
challenging than it should be.

### Constraints conceive creativity

Madeline's controls are also limited: she can only jump, climb walls, and
dash&mdash; nothing more. There are no items, *souls* to collect, nor magic.
Her mechanics emphasize the importance of **player skill** in solving the
platforming puzzles. Given this small moveset, clearing a screen may require
combining these movements to perform acrobatic maneuvers, or taking advantage
of the environment along her way.

<!-- Show madeline's controls: jump, dash climb -->


This brings us to my first reflection point: **the success of Madeline is in my
[our] hands**.  Her wins are my wins, and so are her deaths. It's not because
of a magic item or an overpowered stat boost that will zoom me across the
screen. More importantly, puzzles can be cleared in more ways than one: I find
it fascinating to watch speedrunners clear screens in ways I never imagined.
This removes the "memorization mechanic" where you just need to perform certain
button-presses and you're done. Sure it's constrained, but it's flexible enough
to endow some personal touch in completing these puzzles. In other words,
constraints conceive creativity.

<!-- just get a GIF from a speed run -->

> Constraints conceive creativity

Before, I saw my anxiety as a constraint or weakness&mdash; I worry a lot and
think about things in the future. At first I thought of it as limiting and
crippling, especially given the insurmountable Mountain called Life that I need
to face.

![](/assets/png/celeste/i_cannot_do_this.jpg){:width="560px"}  
{: style="text-align: center;"}


However, as with Madeline's jump, climb, or dash, *constraints
conceive creativity.*[^1] I slowly learned to lean-in to this "weakness." For
example, it made me more confident in my planning skills:[^2] I can anticipate
potential paths where things might go wrong, break down vague objectives into
clearer ones, and so on.  Sure, **it's still difficult**, but just like any of
Celeste's platforming puzzles, I know I can clear it given my limited moveset.


### Forgiveness and Patience

Celeste is self-aware of its difficulty. A key giveaway is the death counter
prominently shown at the end of each level, and some notes such as:

![](/assets/png/celeste/be_proud_death_count.jpg){:width="560px"}  
**Be proud of your death count**: Celeste knows that it's hard, and yes you'll die a lot&mdash; but these small touches helped lighten the mood and shift my perspective
{: style="text-align: center;"}

> In some ways, the ideas of Celeste fit precisely in a platformer game: it's
> about trying over and over again, while overcoming the urge to give up. 

In some ways, the ideas of Celeste fit precisely in a platformer game: it's
about trying over and over again, while overcoming the urge to give up.
However, what differentiates Celeste from similar games is its **forgiveness
and patience**. Sure, there's no health bar, and one tiny mistake kills you, but
death doesn't punish you so hard: instead of repeating the whole chapter, you
immediately start at the last screen you've been to. In addition, resurrection
is quick, Madeline just goes into a Megaman-like poof, and you're back again. 

This differs in some of the platformers I tried (in the course of writing this
post) like [*Super Meat
Boy*](https://store.steampowered.com/app/40800/Super_Meat_Boy/) or [*Dead
Cells*](https://store.steampowered.com/app/588650/Dead_Cells/),[^3] where there is
an element of rage and spite that motivates you to complete a level. Instead,
Celeste the game cheers for you and wishes for you to succeed. Inasmuch as Celeste
is self-aware of its difficulty, it's also self-aware that it isn't
impossible&mdash; you just gotta keep trying.[^4]

In addition, the game is patient in introducing one mechanic after the other.
In the first chapter, it "teaches" you the concept of springs and spikes, then
later on you'll encounter a moving platform, and near the end you'll see a
combination of these mechanics. This "narrative" is done for each chapter, and
in a macro-level, throughout the game.[^5] If, for some instance, I skipped screens
and went to the latter parts of the game, I'd definitely feel intimidated once
I see those spike-covered floors, moving dust-bunnies, and strong winds in one
screen. However, because the game has patiently taught me its mechanics as I
progress, I instead find them more manageable.

![](/assets/png/celeste/celeste_mechanics_intense.webp){:width="560px"}  
{: style="text-align: center;"}

In the end, Celeste's mechanics allows the player to experience Madeline's
struggles throughout the game, while being forgiving and patient about
it. It's wonderfully-tight, given that the last power-up is simply a
double-dash, not some grand zooming ability. The game's final ascent is still
difficult, but it says something: **overcoming anxiety and depression is a
process**&mdash; catharsis is important but it doesn't end there. 

> Overcoming anxiety and depression is a process&mdash; catharsis is important
> but it doesn't end there.

The final level is wonderful because it reminds you of how far you've come.
There will be multiple callbacks to all of the previous chapters' gimmicks, but
this time it feels more doable&mdash; it's all because you failed, you learned,
and you tried again.

## Story in Sounds

In the previous sections, we saw how the narrative and gameplay mechanics
dovetail to form a tight and cohesive experience, enabling me to share with
Madeline's struggles. Those two alone already makes Celeste a wonderful game,
but the masterful way it uses its soundtrack to heighten our experiences brings
this platformer into greater heights.

A major element of Celeste's composition is its use of *leitmotif*, a recurring
musical phrase that represents a theme or idea. In the game, this occured both
in (1) the melody, and (2) the characters' "instruments". Note that I will only
touch specific aspects of the soundtrack in this post, there's definitely a lot
that can be written on the game's OST and I'd happily recommend some works that
explored various aspects of Celeste's music.

### Main melodies

The first few minutes of the game introduce us to two recurring
melodies: the sound of struggle in the [*Prologue*](https://musescore.com/deanshin/scores/5485243), and the main theme in [*First
Steps*](https://musescore.com/deanshin/first-steps---celeste). 

![](/assets/png/celeste/celeste_prologue.webp){:width="560px"}  
{: style="text-align: center;"}

I'm hesitant to label *Prologue*'s melody as a motif because its callback only
happens at the end of the game. When we first encounter it, we're
in the middle of escaping a crumbling bridge. The fast tempo denotes the idea
of the struggle, the intensity increases, then it ends with a falling sound.


![](/assets/png/celeste/prologue_part_2.png){:width="560px"}  
{: style="text-align: center;"}
<p align="center">
<iframe width="560" height="200" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ctuo3ws3EKs" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
**Sound of Struggle**: *Prologue* starts off as calm and mysterious, then proceeds with a rapid succession of notes at the 50-second mark.
{: style="text-align: center;"}


The *Prologue*'s music is memorable because my experience with it is unique.
After I completed the game and joined Celeste's subreddit, I learned that the
tutorial bird should teach you the dash mechanic as you're falling right away.
In my case, I fell (and laughably died) twice before the tutorial bird showed
up.[^6] Coupled with the falling sound (0:56-0:59), this experience cemented
the idea that this game is **really** hard. Deep in my subconscious, those
exact notes and descending tone ingrained the feeling of failure amidst the
struggle. 


![](/assets/png/celeste/celeste_prologue_bridge.webp){:width="560px"}  
**First blood**: My first death in the game came from this crumbling bridge 
{: style="text-align: center;"}

I want you to keep this tone in mind, because its callback later on is
satisfying. Moving on, let's head over one of the most apparent melodies
throughout the game.

The first level&mdash;and coincidentally its soundtrack, *First Steps*&mdash;
introduces us to the main theme:

![](/assets/png/celeste/sheet_first_steps_01.png){:width="560px"}  
![](/assets/png/celeste/sheet_first_steps_02.png){:width="560px"}  
![](/assets/png/celeste/sheet_first_steps_03.png){:width="560px"}  
{: style="text-align: center;"}
<p align="center">
<iframe width="560" height="200" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/N8OHSXvneOE" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
**Sound of Determination**: *First Steps* introduces us right away to the
game's main melody.
{: style="text-align: center;"}

I'd daresay that this could even be Madeline's theme, for we hear this in
crucial points of her climb. In the beginning, her theme evokes a sense of
wonder and exploration. We (the player) only know about the climb, but none of
the emotional undertone Madeline experiences. The atmosphere is blissful and
the song's overall arc is rousing: the initial clap-like beats (0:05) hype us
up, and the synth-like beats in the music's second phase  (starting at 1:04)
reminds us the difficulty of our ascent. It is challenging yet
promising, chock-full of determination that perfectly describes our main
character.

> [Madeline's theme] is challenging yet promising, chock-full of determination
> that perfectly describes our main character.

### Accompaniment

Madeline's theme finds us back in *Madeline and Theo* (1:01), after she experienced
all major challenges on her way up: being chased by her dark doppelgangers,
a difficulty spike in Chapter 3, a boss sequence with a ghastly concierge, a
panic-attack, and so on. *Madeline and Theo* is played during a heartwarming
scene with Theo, their campfire alit, sharing stories about their life. Because
the last time we heard her theme was in *First Steps*, the callback on this
scene evokes newfound determination, but this time, aware of the struggle
the Mountain possesses.

Character instruments also played a huge role in this scene. As a player, I
know by now that Madeline is represented by the piano, and Theo by the guitar.
In *Madeline and Theo*, our protagonist is not alone (and perhaps this is the
first song where Madeline's piano is played with another instrument). She is
accompanied by a guitar, and they play her theme in a harmonious fashion.


![](/assets/png/celeste/madeline_theo.gif){:width="560px"}  
{: style="text-align: center;"}
<p align="center">
<iframe width="560" height="200" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/__oZ-LYZ8pU?playlist=dTIeaqNXseY" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
**Not alone**: *Madeline and Theo* may as well be the first time we hear
Madeline's piano be accompanied by a character instrument. This song then
segues to *Starjump*, which amps up the emotions of this cutscene.
{: style="text-align: center;"}

It is also noteworthy that *Starjump* comes after this song. It is a perfect
interlude that gives a more heightened feeling of overcoming diffifulties along
our way.

Determination comes into play again in *Confronting Myself*, at the final "boss
battle." Madeline is determined to reach into Badeline, resulting into a
"reverse chase sequence" where we're the one running after Badeline and she's
the one running away from us (while shooting lasers and deathly orbs along our
way). In-game, this arc was very long, testing the player's patience and mettle
all throughout.

We also hear the synth, representing Badeline, throughout the game. It tries to
overpower Madeline's theme (and her instrument), in a goth-like chiptune
repertoire&mdash;perfectly apt for a boss battle.

![](/assets/png/celeste/epic_chase_scene.webp){:width="560px"}  
{: style="text-align: center;"}
<p align="center">
<iframe width="560" height="200" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/b_oEDGONSc4" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
**Confronting Myself:** Madeline and Badeline's instruments overpower each other in this epic boss battle. Again, we hear Madeline's theme in the 1:12 mark
{: style="text-align: center;"}

### Refrain

Remember *Prologue*? Its frantic melody will reappear again in *Reach for the
Summit*, during the final ascent. Because my previous experience taught me that
this song is about failure (because oh boy, I died twice in the Prologue), I
got intimidated when I heard its initial notes, especially during the summit
run. As the notes race, I'm starting to doubt if I can actually finish this game...

<p align="center"><iframe width="560" height="200" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ctuo3ws3EKs?start=50&end=62" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
**Frantic Notes:** I started hearing these notes again from the Prologue, teasing  
me for the difficulty to come.
{: style="text-align: center;"}

But in the Final Chapter of Celeste, something has changed, listen carefully on the 30-second mark. Compare this with the original *Prologue* above:

<p align="center">
<iframe width="560" height="200" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iDVM9KED46Q?end=45" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
**Subtle change:** I want you to listen carefully to the opening tune of the final ascent's music,  
*Reach for the Summit.*
{: style="text-align: center;"}

**There's no more falling tone!** It's a subtle difference, but it was replaced by
something more heroic (the rhythm even reminds me of the Avengers theme). It
seems to tell me: "Yes, this is going to be difficult, but this time around,
you can do this." 


![](/assets/png/celeste/celeste_ready_pink.gif){:width="560px"}  
{: style="text-align: center;"}
<p align="center">
<iframe width="560" height="200" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iDVM9KED46Q" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
{: style="text-align: center;"}


...and then it transitions back to Madeline's theme (00:45 onwards). She has
found her bearings and begins the climb. 

### Summit

In the final leg of the Summit, during the 3000-m mark and where the
checkpoints appear, the *Prologue*'s melody comes up again. Like the last time, it
doesn't end with a falling tone but a heroic one. But what you hear next is
powerful:

<p align="center"><iframe width="560" height="200" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iDVM9KED46Q?start=478" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

*Madeline's theme* plays, but it is now a combination of the Piano and the
Synth, singing in a harmonious fashion. During this part, everything
coincides perfectly: the narrative tells us how Madeline works with her
anxiety and depression through Badeline, the mechanic grants us the double-dash
power-up, a product of Madeline and Badeline's fusion, and the music gives us 
a high-beat, perfect symphony of Madeline and Badeline's instruments&mdash;
all combined to pack the perfect gameplay experience of a lifetime.

{: style="text-align: center;"}


In the next section, I'll conclude this series with a short synthesis, a
reflection on my personal journey, and a short discussion on how Celeste has
changed my view on gaming in general.

### Other Sections

* [**Part I: Introduction and Storytelling**](/life/2020/07/31/celeste/): I'll
    introduce Celeste the game, and talk about how its strong narrative has
    drawn me into completing it. 
* [**Part III: Conclusion** (August 22)](/life/2020/08/22/celeste-part-3/): in
    the final part of this series, I'll end with a short Conclusion and
    reflection on Celeste overall, how it changed my perception on video games,
    and more.

### Resources

Here are some of the resources and materials that I used and watched to learn
more and appreciate the beauty of Celeste.

#### Primary Sources

* [*GDC Level Design Workshop: Designing Celeste*](https://youtu.be/4RlpMhBKNr0): a GDC session where Celeste's lead developers talked about the game's level design. It's pretty interesting to see how they conceptualized this early on (note that the talk was done in 2017, before Celeste was released and way before it has been recognized as a hit).
* [*Celeste TGH Speedrun in 1:28:03*](https://youtu.be/-KvjXsJCt1o): this is a
    Celeste speedrun by TGH, see how a pro-player plays the game!

#### Secondary Sources


* [*How Celeste Teaches You Its Mechanics*](https://youtu.be/lZoQ9a7oPvo) and [*Why Does Celeste Feel So Good to Play?*](https://youtu.be/yorTG9at90g): two of my go-to videos if I want to see an in-depth analysis of Celeste's game-design. The first one focuses on level-design, and the latter looks into Madeline's fluid controls.
* [*The Anxiety of Celeste and its Music:*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvETIcMXaEo) this video analyzes Celeste's music
 in the context of anxiety and stress. Its amazing because it also dwells on
 physiological stress, using low-intensity and high-intensity music to
 stimuluate eustress or destress. 
* [*How Celeste's Mirror Temple Creates Fear:*](https://youtu.be/RYlNLVewLe0) a
    good study on game-level design on how Celeste's Chapter 5 evokes the
    emotion of Madeline to the player.
* [*What Makes Celeste's Assist Mode Special:*](https://youtu.be/NInNVEHj_G4)
    one of Game Maker's Toolkit study on what makes Celeste a very accessible
    game, emphasizing the importance of developer intention while balancing
    player preference.
* [*The Magic of Celeste's Farewell DLC:*](https://youtu.be/Zt7xNr9BDqs) I
    don't think I'll be able to finish all of Celeste's B and C sides, much
    more its DLC soon. Thus, I'll hand you over to this video that dives into a
    good analysis of Celeste's Epilogue, Farewell. I see Farewell as a critique
    on Madeline's determination (stubborn determination, to a fault), and also
    underscores the feeling of grief.


### Footnotes

[^1]: A bit off-topic, but this learning, *constraints conceive creativity* made me drawn to pixel art. In Pixel Art, you're mostly working on a small canvass, and it "forces" you to creatively represent small details in low-resolution.
[^2]: I took Clifton's StrengthsFinder test a few months ago, and my Top 2 Strength is [Strategic](https://www.gallup.com/cliftonstrengths/en/252350/strategic-theme.aspx). It is expressed as someone who "create alternative ways to proceed and think in terms of options." It feels validating to see it expressed that way! 
[^3]: Don't get me wrong, I love Dead Cells! Albeit for different reasons (mostly on combat, tactics, and adaptability).
[^4]: I have yet to try the Assist Mode to practice some advanced maneuvers as I learn how to speedrun. Turning on Assist Mode "breaks" the game. However, the [developer's messaging](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NInNVEHj_G4) is wonderful: it's not cheating, it's OK to ask for help and there's no shame in that.
[^5]: The creators of Celeste [conducted a workshop in GDC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RlpMhBKNr0) (Games Developers Conference) about the game's level-design. It's definitely worth a watch if you have half an hour to spare! Very insightful and it shows the level of craftsmanship Matt and his team does.
[^6]: So yes folks, I died in the Prologue!
