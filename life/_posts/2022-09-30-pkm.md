<!--
- My expectations and goals 
    - Use PKM for content creation, maybe help with my job too
- What worked
    - Obsidian is actually a good notes app. 
    - Indexing and searchability helps a lot!
    - Backlinks help
- What didn't work
    - Productive procrastination
    - Upfront energy tending the garden
    - Pen and paper is still nice (gives my notes some personality)
- Things that I find confusing
    - Never learned how to efficiently use the graph
    - Sometimes, the connections already happen in the brain before the system suggests it to me.
- Next steps
    - Start, stop, continue doing
