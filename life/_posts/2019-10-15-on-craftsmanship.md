This is a long post encompassing some of my reflections on craftsmanship,
software, and life. I'll start off by narrating my first cathartic encounter
with a craftsman, then I'll move into my journey of finding my craft, and how
it manifests into my work life (it's not always good!). In the end, I'll
provide a short meta-reflection on how I'm doing today and what these
reflections mean in my career.

## The Soba Story

The year was 2017, and I'm still fresh into my grad school journey in Japan.
I'm starting to settle down, moved to a newer apartment, and made friends with
other foreign students in my cohort. As we're all wide-eyed foreigners in a
beautiful country, we took part in some Japanese cultural activities provided
by the school&mdash; one of which is making soba noodles.

I didn't expect much from spending the weekend making soba noodles, *how life
transforming could it be?* So we entered the function hall and there are around
six tables laid out with some utensils already set up. In front, of course, are
the welcoming faces of the Japanese cultural group. With them, I presume, are
the soba chefs. I could tell because they have these aprons around them and a
colorful handkerchief tied on their foreheads, similar to those 90's rappers in
the Philippines. All of them are quite old, probably in their early 70s, still
healthy and strong as with the standard for most Japanese seniors.

After some greetings and remarks, one of the soba chefs, probably the most
senior of them all by his looks, came to the front and demonstrated how to
make soba. It was very methodical: you make small clumps of buckwheat flour in
a large bowl, you knead it, you flatten it, and then you slice it into strips.
While he's doing that, one of the translators mentioned that **he's been making
soba noodles all his life.** I was so entranced watching him: he seemed to retain
the same vigor and enthusiasm of making soba from his childhood years. I was
also confused: *how can you do one thing for all your life and not be bored by
it?*

The day went on: we made our own noodles, cooked some zaru soba (ざるそば), ate
it, and went home. Little did I know that watching an old man making
soba[^1]&mdash;knowing that he's been doing it all his life&mdash;will become a
theme of my Japanese journey. Looking back, Japan seems to have a strong
tradition of craftsmanship. Be it in pottery, brewing sake (酒), or [making
fountain pens](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1F12qUyIACM), there's always
this recurring image of an old man doing something all his life. 

The idea of a craftsman has been stamped on me ever since that day. Being able
to build things and manifest oneself into something tangible is a meaningful
life to be in. 

## Seeing software as craft

<!-- talk about how this quote speaks to you because of your experience in
Heights, etc. -->
The quote above from Frederick Brooks struck me when I was reading *Mythical
Man-Month*. The way he describes the art of programming as building castles in
the air, as if you're a wizard conjuring thought-stuff from mere incantations
reflects how magical I see programming even up to this day. Another reason is
that he likened a programmer to a poet, and this brought back some memories of
my undergraduate years.

<!-- part of heights, can't really see craft in ECE, used to write poems and make artworks, not particularly good at it, but enjoyed it because of the craftsmanship involved --> 

<!-- Always look for ways to find the same experience in tech -->

<!-- you started taking software seriously within open-source, primarly as a
hobby, no deadlines no clients, etc. -->


<!-- describe the three things that it allowed you to do -->
