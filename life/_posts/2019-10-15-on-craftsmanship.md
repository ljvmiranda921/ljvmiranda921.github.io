This is a long post encompassing some of my reflections on craftsmanship,
software, and life. I'll start off by narrating my first cathartic encounter
with a craftsman, then move into my journey of finding my craft, and how it
manifests into my work life. In the end, I'll provide a short meta-reflection
on how I'm doing today and what these reflections meant for me and my career.

Similar to [my previous blogpost](/life/2018/09/04/my-year-in-commits/), this
is a highly-personal essay on my journey, but I hope that a few nuggets of
insight will surface as you read through my stories and reflections.

## The soba story

The year was 2017, and I'm still fresh into my grad school journey in Japan.
I'm starting to settle down, moved to a newer apartment, and made friends with
other foreign students in my cohort. As we're all wide-eyed foreigners in a
beautiful country, we took part in some Japanese cultural activities provided
by the school&mdash; one of which is making soba noodles.

I didn't expect much from spending the weekend making soba noodles, *how life
transforming could it be?* So we entered the function hall and there are around
six tables laid out with some utensils already set up. In front, of course, are
the welcoming faces of the Japanese cultural group. With them, I presume, are
the soba chefs. I could tell because they have these aprons around them and a
colorful handkerchief tied on their foreheads, similar to those 90's rappers in
the Philippines. All of them are quite old, probably in their early 70s, still
healthy and strong as with the standard for most Japanese seniors.

After some greetings and remarks, one of the soba chefs, probably the most
senior of them by his looks, came to the front and demonstrated how to make
soba. He stepped on the small makeshift stage, dipped his hands in water, and
started his handiwork. It was very methodical: he first made small clumps of
buckwheat flour in a large bowl, then kneaded it, flattened it, and sliced it
into strips.  While making soba, one of the translators mentioned that
*he's been making soba noodles all his life.* I was so entranced watching
him: he seemed to retain the same vigor and enthusiasm of making soba from his
childhood years. I was also confused as a question stuck on me: "How can you
do one thing for all your life and not be bored by it?"

> *"How can you do one thing for all your life and not be bored by it?"*

The day went on: we made our own noodles, cooked some zaru soba (ざるそば), ate
it, and went home. Little did I know that watching an old man making soba[^1]
will become a theme of my Japanese journey. Looking back, Japan seems to have a
strong tradition of craftsmanship. Be it in pottery, brewing sake (酒), or
[making fountain pens](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1F12qUyIACM), there's
always this recurring image of an old person doing something all their lives. 

The idea of a craftsman has been stamped on me ever since that day. Being able
to build things and manifest oneself into something tangible is very
meaningful. For the next few days, and during the rest of graduate school, I
sought ways on finding and honing my craft. 

## Seeing software as craft

> &mdash; The Joys of the Craft, Mythical Man-Month, Brooks, 1975

The quote from Frederick Brooks struck me when I was reading *Mythical
Man-Month*. The way he describes the art of programming as building castles in
the air&mdash; as if you're a wizard conjuring thought-stuff from mere
incantations&mdash; reflects how magical I see programming even up to this
day.[^2] Another reason is that he likened a programmer to a poet, and this
brought back some memories of my undergraduate years.

In hindsight, I may have been looking for a semblance of craftsmanship early on
when I was an undergrad. I joined [Heights](https://heights-ateneo.org/), an
artistic and literary publication, and practiced writing poems and making art.
Encountering various works and artists during deliberations and workshops gave
me an insight on how a medium is used to convey an idea or express one's self.
The experience of **expressing yourself through a medium** has enamored me, and
it's something that I want to recreate in my field.

Again, I imagine the recurring image of the soba-maker: using the flour as his
medium, he trudges the long nights kneading dough and making noodles under some
faint tungsten light. At the end of it all, he looks to his creation and says
to himself: "this is how I make soba, this is different from how other's make
soba because it's mine." Expressing yourself through the medium is a way of
marking yourself to that object&mdash; a deeper connection to one's work that
counters blind mass-production.

<!-- Always look for ways to find the same experience in tech -->
Fast forward to today, I realized that **working in open-source allowed me to
recreate the same experience of craftsmanship** during my Heights days. I'd
consider myself lucky that my initial experience of "serious programming"[^3]
is in open-source. I had the freedom to choose what projects I want to create,
and in no way restrained by any spec or requirements that I should adhere to.
It's like when someone gave me a blank piece of paper and told me: "draw whatever
you want." This may be different, say, if I took a computer science degree and
labored over machine problems or started out programming in a job where I have
lesser freedom to the projects I'll take. Starting out in open-source has been
vital in internalizing the idea that software can be treated as a craft.

### Footnotes

[^1]: Seeing this [video of a man making soba](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3zFiwa8fKs) circulating in the internet motivated me to finish this post. It brought back memories of my experience when I was in Japan.
[^2]: Of course, he followed this with a chapter called "The Woes of the Craft," which is equally true.
[^3]: Let me qualify this word further. Serious programming in this sense means being attuned with industry practices such as testing, documentation, and CI/CD. Although I've learned how to program since high school, I just type-in things without any sensibility if my code is idiomatic.
