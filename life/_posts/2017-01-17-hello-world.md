Hello world! 

I'm now transferring my blog from Worpress into Github pages &mdash;the former
site will be deleted soon. So, if you cannot access
[this](https://ljvmiranda.wordpress.com) link anymore, then that means I have
already done the deed. It seems that I have some pretty popular articles in my
Worpress site, so perhaps I'll start migrating them here.

Here are some reasons why I decided to go for Github pages:

- **Integration to my dev workflow**. I have been using Git extensively, and I
    enjoy versioning my work. That also includes pushing/pulling changes to my
    remote, and practicing continuous integration or deployment. Github pages
    enables me to do just that: I just need to push to `master`, and my page
    will be deployed in no time. In summary, I just want a "hack-ish"
    user-experience.
- **I want to try some web development**. Web developers may scoff at what they
    just read, but migrating to Github Pages enabled me to learn a bit of web
    dev. Even with just a static site generator like Jekyll, I was able to dip
    my toes on the Rails ecosystem, SCSS, and the like.
