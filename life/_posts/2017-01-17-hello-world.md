Hello world! 

I'm now transferring my blog from Worpress into Github pages &mdash;the former
site will be deleted soon. So, if you cannot access
[this](https://ljvmiranda.wordpress.com) link anymore, then that means I have
already done the deed. It seems that I have some pretty popular articles in my
Worpress site, so perhaps I'll start migrating them here.

Here are some reasons why I decided to go for Github pages:

- **Integration to my dev workflow**. I have been using Git extensively, and I
    enjoy versioning my work. That also includes pushing/pulling changes to my
    remote, and practicing continuous integration or deployment. Github pages
    enables me to do just that: I just need to push to `master`, and my page
    will be deployed in no time. *I can also work offline*, and push upstream
    changes to my repository. In summary, I just want a "hack-ish" user-experience.
- **I want to try some web development**. Web developers may scoff at what they
    just read, but migrating to Github Pages enabled me to learn a bit of web
    dev. Even with just a static site generator like Jekyll, I was able to dip
    my toes on the Rails ecosystem, SCSS, and the like.
- **Open-source experience**. I realized that if readers found any mistakes,
    either from grammar or content, they can just go ahead and open up a Pull Request. 
    They don't need to point them out in the comments and wait for me to
    correct them myself. Github integration is pretty good, and I'd love to
    leverage that[^1].

On the other hand, there are still some things
