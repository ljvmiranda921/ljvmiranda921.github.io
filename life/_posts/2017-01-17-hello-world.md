Hi friends, my name is Lj Miranda and welcome to my blog! 

A bit of a background: I'm currently a grad student in [Waseda
University](https://www.waseda.jp/top/en), Japan. Prior to that, I
graduated from [Ateneo de Manila University](http://www.ateneo.edu/)
with a degree in Electronics Engineering and a minor in Philosophy.
I like [programming and building things](https://github.com/ljvmiranda921), and
I'm passionate about this craft.

I started this site to tell my story as I go through my journey in tech. I
believe in technology's enabling power, especially in developing countries like
the Philippines. I hope that I can help usher its potential&mdash;even for just
a little bit. To be honest, I still have a long way to go, and maybe this
blog can track my progress. 

Hoping that you'll have a nice time in this site. If you have any questions or
just wanna reach out, contact me in the links below!
