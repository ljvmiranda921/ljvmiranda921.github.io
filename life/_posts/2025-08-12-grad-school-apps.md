<span class="firstcharacter">B</span>ack in 2021, I decided I wanted to embark on a PhD program to pursue an academic research career.
However, it took me *four years* to finally apply.
What happened, and what took me so long?
In this blog post, I want to reflect on the past three years&mdash;spanning multiple countries, jobs, and experiences.
That journey is finally over, and now I'm preparing myself on the cusp of another one.

This is not a "How to apply to grad school" blog post, but perhaps you'll find something valuable along the way.
If you want an actual guide, I recommend reading John Boaz Lee's [guide](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1N5ETwBh9dyLpxGRKIA9LXXJ_Jy44i1TP/view) (more Filipino context) or Tim Dettmer's [blog post](https://timdettmers.com/2018/11/26/phd-applications/).

Finally, some news: I will be starting my **PhD in X** at **ABC**.
I also got accepted to several universities here in the US (A, B, C), so this admissions cycle was truly a blessing.

### Prelude: the reality of CS grad school applications

As the fields of machine learning and NLP grow every year, the competition for top PhD programs has become increasingly intense.
There was a time when I was looking at the newly-admitted PhD students at Stanford and University of Washington, and it's common to see them with first-author publications in top conferences prior to their PhD.
Although I have worked on NLP-adjacent projects at [Thinking Machines](https://thinkingmachin.es/), I don't have any academic NLP research experience in my profile back in 2021.

In addition, I've learned that a large factor for acceptance to PhD programs are your letters of recommendation (LoR).
Academia has its in-group, and it's quite important that your letter-writers are within this network.
There's nothing nefarious about this: universities have the privilege to be conservative in admitting students due to high demand, and it helps if the Professor you're applying to knows who your recommenders are.

Early on, I realized that pivoting from industry to academia will entail a lot of hard work.
A part of me thought that maybe I should have just continued to PhD right after my Masters.
Looking back, my experience in the industry validated that (1) I still like doing research that I'm willing to sacrifice do a big pivot and (2) I can always go back to industry if this experiment-of-a-pivot didn't pan out.

### The big pivot and the long road to PhD applications

Inasmuch as I'd like to think that I got into top schools solely because of my efforts, I got lucky because of the people who took chances on me.
My first break into NLP research was in spaCy, when Matt and Sofie supported me in co-leading (with Akos!) our hash-embeddings technical report.
This gave me the confidence to undertake my own independent work for Tagalog NLP, which led to calamanCy and TLUnified-NER.

At Ai2, I'm lucky to have been mentored by Pradeep and worked on several projects with Yizhong.

**I think I've developed a mantra over time: people over projects, projects over publications.**
