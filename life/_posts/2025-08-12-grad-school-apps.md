There was a time when I was looking at the newly-admitted PhD students at Stanford and University of Washington, and it's common to see them with first-author publications to top conferences prior to their PhD.
In addition to **research experience**, a large factor for acceptance are your **letters of recommendation (LoR)**.
Unfortunately, academia has its in-group, and it's quite important that your letter-writers are within this group.
It's crazy competitive out there.

Inasmuch as I'd like to think that I got into the same schools solely because of my efforts, I got lucky because of people who took chances on me.
