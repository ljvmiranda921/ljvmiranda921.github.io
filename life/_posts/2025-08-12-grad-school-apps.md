<span class="firstcharacter">B</span>ack in 2021, I decided I wanted to embark on a PhD program to pursue an academic research career.
However, it took me *four years* to finally apply.
*What happened, and what took me so long?*
In this blog post, I want to reflect on the past four years&mdash;spanning multiple countries, jobs, and experiences.
That journey is finally over, and now I'm preparing myself on the cusp of another one.

This is not a "How to apply to grad school" blog post, but perhaps you'll find something valuable along the way.
If you want an actual guide, I recommend reading John Boaz Lee's [guide](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1N5ETwBh9dyLpxGRKIA9LXXJ_Jy44i1TP/view) (more Filipino context) or Tim Dettmer's [blog post](https://timdettmers.com/2018/11/26/phd-applications/).

ðŸ“£ Finally, some news: I will be starting my **PhD in X** at **ABC**.
I also got accepted to several universities here in the US (A, B, C), so this admissions cycle was truly a blessing.

*All photos you'll see below were taken by a Gameboy Camera. I realized when writing this blog post that my camera captured all events in the past four years. For more photos, check out my [gallery](/gallery).*


### Prelude: the reality of CS grad school applications

As the fields of machine learning and NLP grow every year, the **competition for top PhD programs has become increasingly competitive.**
There was a time when I was looking at the newly-admitted PhD students at Stanford and University of Washington, and it's common to see them with first-author publications in top conferences prior to their PhD.
Although I have worked on NLP-adjacent projects at [Thinking Machines](https://thinkingmachin.es/), I don't have any academic NLP research experience in my profile back in 2021.
Early on, I realized that **pivoting from industry to academia will entail a lot of hard work.**
A part of me thought that maybe I should have just continued to PhD right after my Masters.
Looking back, my experience in the industry validated that (1) I still like doing research that I'm willing to sacrifice do a big pivot and (2) I can always go back to industry if this experiment-of-a-pivot didn't pan out.

### The big pivot and the long road to PhD applications

Inasmuch as I'd like to think that I got into top schools solely because of my efforts, I got lucky because of the **people who took chances on me.**
My first break into NLP research was in [spaCy](https://spacy.io), when Matt, Ines, and Sofie supported me in co-leading (with Akos!) our [hash-embeddings technical report](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.09255).
That experience opened up a lot of opportunities, like being able to collaborate with linguists like Anders S&oslash;gaard.
This gave me the confidence to undertake my own independent work for Tagalog NLP, which led to [calamanCy](https://aclanthology.org/2023.nlposs-1.1.pdf) and [TLUnified-NER](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07161).
In addition, working with Magda and Vincent on incorporating LLMs in the Prodigy annotation tool helped inform my current and future research directions on LLM annotation.

At AI2, I was fortunate to be mentored by Pradeep and to collaborate on several projects with Yizhong. 
My experience at AI2 shaped my research interests and solidified what **type of researcher I want to be: competent, steadfast, and kind.**
I still remember when we were unable to submit our first project in time for a conference due to unexpected results, yet they remained supportive as we went back to the drawing board. 
Later, they (together with Nathan) trusted me to deliver the preference scaling aspect of the [T&uuml;lu 3](https://allenai.org/papers/tulu-3-report.pdf) and [OLMo 2](https://allenai.org/olmo) project, which was something I was proud to accomplish last year. 
Even after working on spaCy previously, I still felt like an outsider in the NLP research community, but they made me feel welcome![^1]
Those small gestures meant a lot&mdash;and I hope I can be that person for another fledgling researcher in the future.

**I think I've developed a mantra over time: people over projects, projects over publications.**

### On choosing programs

<!-- (this is not the first paragraph)  -->
I feel privileged and blessed to have this problem of choice.
Now that I'm past the hump of PhD applications, I'd like to give back: if you're a Filipino NLP researcher applying for a postgraduate degree abroad, I will help review your research statements!
In addition, if you're interested to do research on Tagalog and Filipino NLP with the intention to publish, feel free to reach out and I'm happy to mentor you!



[^1]: There are many people in Ai2 who helped me of course: Yanai, Valentina, Faeze, Sachin, Hannah and Noah (and much more)! It does take a village. I'm also thankful to Pradeep, Hanna+Yizhong who drafted my recommendation letters!
