<span class="firstcharacter">B</span>ack in 2021, I decided that I want to embark on a PhD program in order to pursue an academic research career.
However, it took me *three years* to finally apply.
What happend and what took me so long?
In this blog post, I want to reflect on the past three years: spanning multiple countries, jobs, and people.
The journey is finally over, and now I'm preparing myself on the cusp of another one.
