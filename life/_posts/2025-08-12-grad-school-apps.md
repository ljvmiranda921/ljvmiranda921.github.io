<span class="firstcharacter">B</span>ack in 2021, I decided I wanted to embark on a PhD program to pursue an academic research career.
However, it took me *three years* to finally apply.
What happened, and what took me so long?
In this blog post, I want to reflect on the past three years&mdash;spanning multiple countries, jobs, and experiences.
That journey is finally over, and now I'm preparing myself on the cusp of another one.

This is not a "How to apply to grad school" blog post, but perhaps you'll find some nuggets along the way.
If you want an actual guide, I recommend reading John Boaz Lee's [guide](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1N5ETwBh9dyLpxGRKIA9LXXJ_Jy44i1TP/view) (more Filipino context) or Tim Dettmer's [blog post](https://timdettmers.com/2018/11/26/phd-applications/).

Finally, some news:


### The reality of CS grad school applications

As the fields of machine learning and NLP grow every year, the competition for top PhD programs has become increasingly intense.
There was a time when I was looking at the newly-admitted PhD students at Stanford and University of Washington and it's common to see them having first-author publications to top conferences.
In addition to **research experience**, a large factor for acceptance are your **letters of recommendation (LoR)**.
Unfortunately, academia has its in-group, and it's quite important that your letter-writers are within this group.
Indeed, CS PhD applications at top programs are crazily competitive.

Back in 2021, I did feel disadvantaged sometimes: I'm fresh from the industry, and I don't have both.
But now I realize that this feeling allowed me to see research differently.
Instead of fixating on how many papers I write, I focused on what type of research (or *project*) I'm excited to do. 
Instead of thinking about who my letter-writers are, I think about who are the people I enjoy working with. 
Early on I had this mantra: "projects over pubs (publications); people over projects."


> Projects over publications; people over projects.
