Celeste is one of the most memorable games I've played this year. A
brilliant masterpiece, it developed in me a profound appreciation of games
as a vehicle for creative expression. Read more about my journey in scaling
Celeste Mountain in this three-part series.


* [**Part I: Introduction and Storytelling** (July 31)](/life/2020/07/31/celeste): I'll introduce
    Celeste the game, and talk about how its strong narrative has drawn me into
    completing it. 
* [**Part II: Mechanics is the Message, Story in Sounds** (August 15)](/life/2020/08/15/celeste-part-2): I'll talk about how
    Celeste's precision-platformer mechanics and masterful soundtrack contributed to the storyline and
    enriched the gameplay and experience even further.
* [**Part III: Conclusion** (August 22)](/life/2020/08/22/celeste-part-3): in the final part of this series,
    I'll end with a short Conclusion and reflection on Celeste overall, how it
    changed my perception on video games, and more.

If you haven't played Celeste, I highly-recommend that you try it out and
finish the main storyline. Don't be discouraged by its supposed
difficulty&mdash; it's part of the journey and the developers ensured that
their game caters to both casuals and advanced players alike. For only [10
USD on Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/504230/Celeste/), you get
access to its rich content and thoughtful narrative.
