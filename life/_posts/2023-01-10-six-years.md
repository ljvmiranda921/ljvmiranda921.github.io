<span class="firstcharacter">I</span> don't remember the exact date I started my
blog. My [first commit](https://github.com/ljvmiranda921/ljvmiranda921.github.io/commit/5a107a575601952a5cbfea964cf9a23346b7fd20)
was January 17, 2017, but it may be older than that, as I squashed all my
commits in 2016 (I know, it's bad practice). I published my [first blog
post](/life/2017/01/16/hello-world/) on January 16, but I've been blogging in
WordPress long before.  So I'll just take what's on the record&mdash; **January 16**
was the birth of this blog.

> January 16 was the birth of this blog.

Six years! In the greater scheme of things, six years is just a pebble. People I
look up to, like [Simon Willison](https://simonwillison.net/2022/Jun/12/twenty-years/) and 
[Scott Hanselman](https://www.hanselman.com/blog/i-got-tired), have been blogging for
over twenty years. But I'll pat myself on the back: it is easy to start things,
but sticking to it for long periods of time is already an achievement.

I started this blog because [I wanted to record my tech journey](/about/). At
first, I was writing for myself. My initial posts were grad school assignments,
notes from online courses, and how-tos on technical problems. Then, when I
started working for a consulting firm, I wrote a few industry analyses and
opinions. Now that I'm working for an open-source library, I'm diving deep into
linguistics and natural language processing (NLP). You can definitely trace my
career path through my [Notebook](/notebook/)! 

In this blog post, I want to talk about six lessons I learned from this journey.

## 1. Writing output is proportional to input 

I used to blog sporadically until I decided to publish one blog post
per month. I thought that would be an easier cadence, for I have one month to
write something. However, by June, I was running out of ideas! So I was
scrambling for something to write, just any output, as long as I had something.
*Nothing came out.* Instead, I took the pressure off writing when I was in
between jobs: I focused on reading books, playing games, and immersing myself
in different media.

The following month, I was full of zest. Writing came easy, and my drafts flowed
like water. At that moment, I learned that if I want to be consistent with my
outputs, I need to be consistent with my inputs. The two are directly
proportional.

If we think of writing as a way to organize our thoughts, then there should be
thoughts to begin with. Writing is thinking. We collate these thoughts from
different inputs (books, newsletters, social media, etc.) and transform them
into something uniquely our own.

I also realized that my intake of information should go beyond quantity.
Subscribing to everything is easy but can also be counterproductive. So I
learned to curate what I consume. This led to practices that I developed over
time:
- **Have a backlog of ideas.** I use [Github Issues](https://github.com/ljvmiranda921/ljvmiranda921.github.io/issues) to keep track of random ideas I
come across from time to time. I'm also liberal in closing issues I don't find
interesting anymore. 
- **Use RSS Readers and Twitter Lists.** I use [Inoreader](https://inoreader.com) to curate the content I
consume from the internet. The same goes for Twitter and Mastodon. Sometimes,
all I need is a chronological feed. Although social media recommendations help
with exploration, they are overwhelming.
- **Take notes!** I usually have [a notebook at hand](/life/2022/08/04/pen-and-paper/) to process insights and
"rehearse" blog posts. My prompt usually goes like this: "If I write a blog post
about this topic, what would be the title? What will be the headers?"

These practices instilled the idea that the act of writing happens before I open
my text editor. It also shows how integral writing (or blogging) is in my
thinking process. The quality of my outputs is proportional to the quality of my
inputs.

## 2. Views are nice, but they're not everything

I used to enjoy writing introductory articles. I get to exercise my teaching
muscles and draw many readers! Numbers going up gives a surge of dopamine. It
makes your writing feel valued. However, I find it unsatisfying. I realized
early on that I didn't want my blog to stay in beginner purgatory. It doesn't
reflect why I started my blog in the first place, that is, to trace my tech
journey. I want to see myself grow. Views do not measure that.

So I started writing fewer beginner blog posts. I noticed that the number of
views dropped significantly. It seems that the two are inversely correlated.[^1]
However, the number of hits is of good quality: sometimes, I get the occasional
thank you e-mail or a new connection. Knowing that one person resonates with
your niche interests feels more satisfying! 

[^1]: 

    Of course, there's also the possibility that I'm not sharing with the right
    audience. Occasionally when my blog post shows up in [Hacker
    News](https://news.ycombinator.com), I get an immense amount of hits and
    feedback. But those are rare occurrences, and I don't want to count on that.

I think it is hypocritical to say that I don't care about views. Of course, it
feels good to be read. So over the years, I tried to maintain a ratio of writing
"two for me and one for them."

> "two [blog posts] for me and one for them [the audience]."

{: style="text-align: center;"}

This rule means that for every two posts I write for myself, I *can* write
another introductory blog post. Writing for myself feels satisfying, doubly
so when it gets folks reading. On the other hand, writing beginner blog posts is
a slog, and there's an off-chance that no one reads them. So probability-wise,
writing for myself most of the time has a higher expected value.

> I make it a point to endow my perspective when writing beginner blog posts.
> There could be a hundred blog posts about X, but my view and take on it are
> unique.

Lastly, I make it a point to endow my perspective when writing beginner blog
posts. For example, there could be a fitting analogy for a particular concept or
a compelling project for a specific library. There could be a hundred blog posts
about X, but my view and take on it are unique. It also makes the writing
process more exciting!

## 3. Optimize for readers who skim

One thing I realized as a consumer and producer of information is that, I'm
biased toward my writing. I read my blog line by line, slowly digesting the
words I wrote. This is not the case for other content. I read voraciously,
skimming through text and figures. Perhaps others read my blog the same way. So,
I learned to optimize for the reader's time. Every time I finish a blog post, I
ask myself: would a reader get what I'm trying to say if they just skimmed
through the post?

> Every time I finish a blog post, I ask myself: would a reader get what I'm trying to
> say if they just skimmed through the post?

At an extreme level, I could've just written a Twitter thread of bullet points.
But I write prose to express myself. So instead, I learned to **tell a story
through headings.** Yes, headings. I got this trick while working in consulting:
slide headers shouldn't just be sterilized scientific paper jargon like
Introduction, Methodology, or Conclusion. Instead, headings should at least form
a sentence when read from start to end. So if a reader just reads my headers, I
hope that they take something away from it. Of course, I still need to improve
at this practice, but it helps to focus on one's discussion!

> The key takeaway is to make a huge blob of text more approachable.

Another practice I learned early on is to **include a lot of illustrations
deliberately.** There are many good tools for drawing simple charts. Over the
years, I jumped from
[LaTeX/TikZ](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/TikZ_package),
[Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/), [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/), and
[TLDraw](https://www.tldraw.com/). This 2023, I plan to be more consistent with
my design and use Figma with custom components. For example, if you look at this
blog post, the style looks like it was drawn from Tikz, but it's all Figma.
Excalidraw and TLDraw do not fit the "look" of my blog, whereas Tikz and
Inkscape are hard to use. The key takeaway is to make a huge blob of text more
approachable. It can be through formatting, content structure, or illustrations.

## 4. Write a first draft when I'm inspired

This lesson goes against the usual adage that one should not wait for
inspiration to start writing. However, inspiration is a huge factor in my
blogging enjoyment. It also ties into my first lesson: to get consistent ideas,
I need to draw from many sources of inspiration. The converse is also true: I
must drop everything and write a first draft when I'm suddenly inspired by
something. 

I find that **inspiration has a half-life.** It is a function of time. As time
passes, I get less inspired. Perhaps this is but a symptom of shiny object
syndrome: I get bored and start looking for other exciting things to do.
Moreover, once I see my blog post taking shape, the last 10% becomes harder to
do. Weird!

> I find that inspiration has a half-life. It is a function of time.
> Throughout my blogging experience, I learned to manage my inspiration.

Throughout my blogging experience, I learned to **manage my inspiration.** I
think I'm getting better at it. When inspiration starts decaying, I switch
things up and pour my effort into editing. Usually, I take a day or two not
thinking about the blog post, and then go into editing mode. This cadence and
variety help keep the momentum and add a forcing function to stall that
half-life. *Pre-writing* also helps.  Having the materials and references ready
hastens the process. I workshop a title, draft my headings, and then write the
key takeaways. The process of writing is then a matter of expanding these bullet
points into prose.

Lastly, I am indiscriminate in *discarding drafts* I find no enjoyment in
anymore (when inspiration turns to zero).  Sure, there may be a sunk cost, but I
can always reuse paragraphs or analogies in a future blog post. I don't
permanently delete drafts; I keep them in a `_drafts` folder or
[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md).
