Last night, I gave a talk about Geomancer in Databeers Manila. It was a great
night! I was able to share one of my works in Thinking Machines and talk more
about my passion in open-source.

The Databeers format is really interesting. We're not encouraged to show code
nor equations in our slides, else we need to chug down a bottle of beer!
Unfortunately, my topic is about a Python library, and so my demo slide
"merited" a chug in front of the audience!

The best part about Databeers is the community. It was awesome meeting old
friends and new, and talk about data over beer!

Will definitely come back for more!
