---

As the pandemic rages and forced everyone into lockdown, I rekindled my love
for video games. Prior to 2020, I only play casual on mainstream titles (Mobile
Legends, Pok√©mon, etc.) and saw them nothing more as a way to pass the time.
However, after downloading Steam last May, my collection has expanded and my
taste for gaming has refined.

In this blogpost, I want to celebrate the games I've played through an awards
night. It's special because the characters I've met and the stories they shared
accompanied me in the middle of the pandemic. Of course, I am by no means a
game journalist and all winners are based from my personal taste.


## Rules

1. **I will only include games that I finished, excluding DLCs or extra
   content.** As long as I finished the main storyline, I will put it in the
   list. It doesn't matter if I wasn't able to achieve full completion. The
   only exception for this is the *Best Ongoing* award.
2. **I will include games I've bought this year, irregardless of their
   publication date.** So if a game has been released two years ago, but I've
   only played them this year, then I'll still put in the list. You might
   probably see some 2015 or 2018 titles here.
3. For each Award category below[^1], I will choose (1) winner and optionally, one to
   two (1-2) runner-ups:

    | Category             | Description                                                              |
    |:---------------------|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
    |Game of the Year      | the defining game of my year, the best overall experience.               |
    |Best Action Game      | the best game in an action genre focusing on combat.                     |
    |Sit Back and Relax    | the game you play after a long hard day, your moment of zen.              |
    |Best Score            | the game that triumphs with its catchy tunes and reflective music.       |
    |Best Narrative        | the game that gripped me with its narrative and storytelling.            |
    |Best Art              | the most visually-appealing game with its creative direction.            |
    |Best Ongoing          | the standout game that I'm still currently playing.                      |
    |Developer of the Year | the game developer or studio that made a positive impact on me.          |

## Awardees

### Sit Back and Relax

These games are perfect after a long hard day, just as you hear the light rain
fall outside the window while sipping a cup of hot chocolate for the night. The
atmosphere, music, and visuals evoke a sense of calm, and the difficulty
invites flow than frustration.

            <p><b><i>A Short Hike</i></b> takes the top spot in this
            category. Your only objective is to reach the mountain's summit.
            The fun part is that the game won't rush you through it.  Instead,
            it presents a tiny open world where exploration and "getting lost" is
            key&mdash;you meet new friends, play mini-games (my favorite is
            volleyball), and get to know the island.</p><p> Even after I
            completed the game, I still visit the island every now and then!
            For 2020, I consider <i>A Short Hike</i> my happy place.</p>

            <p>At first glance, <b><i>Terraria</i></b> may not be the game you play to
            relax: you fight hordes of zombies, face Eldritch horrors, and stop
            your world from being corrupted. However, I find that once you get
            past through the initial learning curve, <i>Terraria's</i> gameplay
            loop induces flow.
            </p>
            <p>One of the best parts of my <i>Terraria</i> experience is when I
            played co-op with my girlfriend. It's fun to hunt monsters, build
            houses, and explore the procedurally-generated world as if we're in
            the same place. Terraria also got a new update, so perhaps it's
            time to once again don that armor and start hacking away!</p>

### Best Score

This award goes to the game that expertly used its music to enrich its
atmosphere, narrative, and gameplay. Off-game, the developers may have
taken extra steps to cater their music-loving fans by providing vinyl records
and remixes. Knowing myself, their OST album must be on loop on Spotify for days!

            <td>
            <p>
            It's fitting that the winner for Best Score is a game about a
            singer, Red, who has lost her voice. <b><i>Transistor's</i></b> <a
            href="https://open.spotify.com/album/3B0PgLmgaW0gJth55ApWbw">music</a>
            is a treasure: personally I enjoy the triad of <i>Impossible</i>,
            <i>Blank Canvas</i>, and <i>Paper Boats</i>, they take me back
            to the final sequences of the game. 
            </p>
            <p>Gameplay-wise, I love that Red has a <a
            href="https://transistor-archive.fandom.com/wiki/Hum">hum
            button</a>: a moment of calm amidst destruction. Supergiant Games just released an 
            <a

            <td>
            <p><b><i>Celeste's</i></b> music is nothing short of fantastic. It nails
            down the theme of determination as you climb the titular mountain.
            Lena Raine's masterful use of <i>leitmotif</i> is reflected through
            the characters and pays-off satisfyingly in the game's main
            beats.</p> <p>In addition, the game's <a

            remixes</a> (known as their B-side track), is always a joy to
            listen to. I personally like 2 Mello's <a

            Temple Remix</a> and In Love with a Ghost's <a

### Best Narrative

This award goes to the game with almost perfect storytelling.  The plot is
accessible, and offers layers of meaning when closely read.  In addition, the
game's narrative elements are elevated by its gameplay, scoring big payoffs
during the  crucial points of its story.


<div style="overflow-x:auto; display: block;">
<table style="width: 700px">
    <colgroup>
        <col span="1" style="width: 10%;">

            <td style="text-align:center;"><b>Award</b></td>
            <td style="text-align:center;"><b>Title</b></td>
            <td><b>Citation</b></td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size:3rem;">üëë</span></td>
            <td><img src="/assets/png/goty/celeste.jpg" style="min-width:100px;width:200px"></td>
            <td>
                <p><b><i>Celeste's</i></b> story is simple&mdash; it's just a
                girl climbing a mountain. There are no big twists nor subverted
                expectations, it's linear through and through. However, it
                tells a compelling, character-driven story that has touched me
                in many ways. It's so good that I wrote a <a
                href="/life/2020/08/22/scaling-celeste-mountain/">three-part
                essay</a> on it!
                </p>
                <p><i>Celeste</i> stood out because its gameplay lent itself to
                the story.  Precision-platformers are notoriously frustrating,
                but this is exactly what the story wants you to feel. Every
                moment is powerful, and it'll be one of the bests in my gaming
                history.</p>

            <td>
                <p>On the other end of the spectrum is <b><i>Pyre</i></b>, with
                its innovative gameplay, merry cast of characters, and multiple
                endings.  Each character is well-made, and their interaction
                with you differs for each playthrough.  </p><p><i>Pyre's</i>
                main theme of <i>found family</i> shines.  You get to forge
                strong bonds with the <a

                know their stories, and make the tough decision when the time
                comes. <i>Pyre</i> is a game that I hope I can experience again

### Best Art

This award goes to the game with stunning graphics, clear presentation, and
impressive art style.  I appreciate games with a distinct look, and flexes it
without overloading the player.

<div style="overflow-x:auto; display: block;">
<table style="width: 700px">
    <colgroup>
        <col span="1" style="width: 10%;">

    <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td style="text-align:center;"><b>Award</b></td>
            <td style="text-align:center;"><b>Title</b></td>

          <tr>
            <td style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size:3rem;">üëë</span></td>
            <td><img src="/assets/png/goty/hollow_knight.jpg" style="min-width:100px;width:200px"></td>
            <td>
                <p><b><i>Hollow Knight</i></b> is a modern masterpiece. The character
                designs are clean and simple, but they mesh with a sprawling
                background to provide an atmospheric look. From the lush
                jungles of Greenpath, to the ruined City of Tears, <i>Hollow
                Knight</i>'s art makes you feel that you're there.  </p>
                <p>Aside from its gorgeous art, <i>Hollow Knight's</i> visual
                design is well-directed. Each biome is color graded, blobs of
                infection contrasts the background, and animation is
                well-choreographed. To sum, this game is a work of art.
                </p>
            </td>

          <tr>

            <td>
                <p>Even after 9 years, <b><i>Bastion</i></b>'s art still holds.
                The lush digitally-painted environment, and the bright
                bittersweet theme of a fallen world caught me off-guard.
                There's a certain level of craftsmanship that Jen Zee and
                Supergiant exuded in this game.
                </p>
                <p>I also enjoyed reading case-studies on how they managed to
                render large assets in this game. I highly-recommend watching
                GiantBomb's <a
                href="https://www.giantbomb.com/bastion/3030-32085/videos/">Building
                the Bastion</a> series. It's a perfect case-study of good game
                optimization in XNA.</p>

### Best Action Game

This award goes to the game with a combat-oriented gameplay. They exemplify
good battle mechanics, with a wide-array of synergies and options for the
player to experiment upon. Each fight requires some strategy and thought, not
just a simple hack-and-slash.

            synergies and combos!</p> <p>It's a game
            about managing risk and reward as you make tough decisions in your

### Best Ongoing 

This award goes to the games that I'm still playing, but has already blown me
away. I can't put them in other categories yet because I haven't finished them,
but they're so good that I already want to talk about them! I'm pretty sure
that they'll be strong contenders for my next year's game awards.

            purgatory to the afterlife, you learn about their stories, then
            once ready you let them go for good. As a resource management
            simulator, the gameplay loop is relaxing. </p> <p>It's a good game
            to process grief, whatever form it took in our lives. It is pure
            and bittersweet, exploring the themes of mortality and
            relationships.  As one Steam review says: "If 2020 break [sic] your

            and I'm already amazed by it! Its rogue-like structure also made it
            very addicting! As all card-games go, you think about synergies and
            combos, but the variety of plays you can do in your deck kept the
            game fresh after hours of game time!</p>
            <p>I just started playing again after a brief hiatus due to
            focusing on <i>Hollow Knight</i>, so I'm not yet deep into the

### Developer of The Year

This award is given to the developer or studio that has made a positive impact
on me. They've pushed the boundaries of what it means to make games, and more
or less I've played all their titles!

            <p>Hands down, <b><i>Supergiant Games</i></b> earns the top spot in
            this category. I believe it's hard to produce a highly-acclaimed
            game, but doing it four times is almost genius. The level of
            craftsmanship and innovation they've added to all their games made
            me love the group. I highly-recommend watching their <a

### Game of The Year

This award is given to the game that has made an impact on me this year. In
addition, it exemplified quality in both its artistic, musical, and narrative
aspects&mdash;making it one of the games that defined my 2020.

            <p><b><i>Celeste</i></b> is my game of the year.  It taught me how
            to deal with my struggles and overcome difficult situations, both
            in-game and in real life. The game feels personal, and perhaps
            that's what it wants me to feel. The gameplay, sountrack, and
            narrative work together to convey the themes of acceptance,
            determination, and love.  It's a beautiful game and I wrote more
            about it in this <a

            this one is no different. <b><i>A Short Hike</i></b> is a beautiful
            surprise that I just only played last November. It speaks about
            taking a break, friendship, and connectedness. Despite that, the
            game's quite chill, with a good soundtrack following you as you
            traverse the mountain. As I've said before, Hawk Peak Provincial
            Park is my happy place.</p>

            <td><p>Lastly, <b><i>Hollow Knight's</i></b> expansive world of
            Hallownest is as perfect as it should be. The gameplay and
            exploration is rewarding: I still remember the first time I saw the
            City of Tears, and the moment I first defeated the Mantis Lords.
            Its breathtaking atmosphere made me feel that that their world is
            so alive, as if they're just there somewhere. With stunning art and
            gorgeous visuals, <i>Hollow Knight</i> deserves to be one of my top
            games this year.

## Next Year 

I can say that my gaming life has only started this year, so I'm definitely
looking forward to all the games that I'll play for the next! Here's a low-down
of the titles I'm looking forward to play, and unreleased games that I'm so
hyped about!

### Games I look forward to play

These are games that I already have in my collection, and they're just waiting
for me to launch and sink hours on them.

            <td><p>Needless to say, with all the accolades and awards they
            received this year, <b><i>Hades</i></b> is my most-hyped game of 2021. I predict that <i>Hades</i>
            is an example of, "what if <i>Dead Cells</i> has a good story?"
            With rogue-lite progression (one of my favorite genres) and
            Supergiant's touch of storytelling, I feel that <i>Hades</i> is
            another strong contender for my next year's Game Awards.</p></td>

          <tr>
            <td><img src="/assets/png/goty/disco_elysium.jpg" style="min-width:100px;width:200px"></td>
            <td><p>I am excited to play <b><i>Disco Elysium</i></b> because it
            will introduce me into a new genre I've never played before&mdash;
            detective problem-solving with DnD elements. I feel that it's only
            unique to this game, but upon seeing the gameplay online, I dig
            this mechanic.</p>
            <p>I actually spent a few minutes playing it, and I'm so amazed by
            the possibilities in this game (I just need a new graphics card
            haha). Hoping to sink more hours into it next year!</p>

            <td><p>Whenever I tell someone how I love <i>Hollow Knight</i>, the
            common response is if I've played <b><i>Ori and the Blind
            Forest</i></b>. Friends, I haven't, but hopefully next year! I love
            platformers and I think that with its gorgeous visuals, I'd enjoy
            going through this game.</p>
            <p>I'm aware that they recently released <i>Ori and the Will of
            Wisps</i>, a metroidvania akin to <i>Hollow Knight</i>. I'm also
            excited to play that, but we'll see if I'll dig their first
            installment.</p>

            Hornet's princess-protector and chosen one character, so I'm very
            excited to see how <i>Silksong</i> will play out. She has more
            spunk, compared to our Knight's edgy silence. In addition, her
            moveset is much more fluid and fast-paced, so I'm keen to imagine
            how boss fights will work.</p><p>All in all, always hyped for
            <i>Silksong</i>. My prediction is mid or late 2021, but I hope I'm
            wrong in a good way!</p>

            <td><p>I've been following news about <b><i>Sea of Stars</i></b>
            ever since their <a
            href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/sabotagestudio/sea-of-stars">Kickstarter</a>
            launched last year. Since I grew up playing a bit of Pokemon and
            Final Fantasy, I'm drawn to its turn-based combat mechanic, it
            feels like home. Unlike Pokemon, I like the idea of not having
            random encounters in your trail, it's good to see the enemies in
            the overworld so that I can plan ahead whether to engage them or
            not.</p><p>If executed properly, I predict that <i>Sea
            Of Stars</i> will be a strong contender for next year's Game
            Awards&mdash;and I'm not talking about mine.</p>

            href="https://youtu.be/4Jvne3fOwj8">trailer</a>, I encourage you to
            see it now! Set in an apocalyptic society, you follow the story of
            two of its inhabitants to discover the secret of their world's
            past. Combat looks fantastic too, and there's a lot of
            environmental puzzles to solve.</p> <p>The game looks wonderful to
            look at, with its impressively-drawn pixel art world and slick
            animations&mdash; each frame is like a cover on a lofi hiphop
            album. The trailer's music sounds fantastic too! It reminds me a
            bit of Shovel Knight. I have high hopes for this game come 2021.</p>

            highly recommend watching the <a
            href="https://youtu.be/y8bcIzVtLhQ">trailer</a> (the music sounds
            amazing too!). The details about the story are a bit sparse: it's a
            coming-of-age story, there's some clans, and that's it. Either way,
            I'm excited for the seemingly open-world gameplay it introduces.
            After playing <i>A Short Hike</i>, I realized that I enjoy games in
            this genre (please recommend me more open-world titles!).</p>
            <p>The trailer's been released since 2018, so I'm hoping for a 2021
            release just like <i>Silksong</i>.</p>

## Conclusion

![](/assets/png/goty/goty_sm.png)

To end my 2020 Game of the Year Awards, all I can say is that 2020 has been my
Year of the Games. I developed a deeper appreciation to games this year, and I
saw them as tools for creative expression. You'd probably notice that most of
my titles are indies, and I think it speaks alot about the quality and
craftsmanship indie game developers have. 

Lastly, being an adult with money to buy games feels like candyland!  I'm still
exploring this hobby until next year, but I started dabbling a bit by creating
small games in PICO-8. I realized that it's very mathematically involved,
computing jump trajectories, momentum, collision and more. It's a fun
experience, and I think that by playing games, I develop a certain level of
sensibility that I can apply to the things I create.

I'd like to thank all game developers and indie studios for the games that
accompanied me during this pandemic, you are the real winners!
