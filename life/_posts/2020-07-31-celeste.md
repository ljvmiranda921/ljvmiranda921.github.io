## Introduction: the first steps

**Prologue:** I've never been into video games when I was young. [^1] More often
than not I see them as mere distractions not requiring serious thought nor
reflection. Everything changed during the pandemic lockdowns: I need to find a
way to fill my weekends that doesn't involve programming nor code. [^2] So I
downloaded Steam, purchased my first few games (all indies)&mdash; *Terraria*,
*Stardew Valley*, *Celeste* &mdash; and made the jump.


[Celeste](http://www.celestegame.com/) is a charming platformer where you play
a character named Madeline, a young woman dead-set on climbing the top of the
titular Mountain.  Along the way she'll meet new friends, deal with her inner
demons, and survive the hazards beset her trail. 

Sure, it's *just* a game about climbing a mountain, but it triumphs by pulling
me in to the struggles of Madeline, and connecting it to my own experiences
without feeling forced. Celeste was able to achieve this with its (1) masterful
storytelling, (2) tight mechanics and gameplay, and (3) layered sensory
experience with its visuals and sound. By seeing how these three were weaved
together into a singular *experience*, I developed a profound appreciation for
this medium and saw its potential for creative expression.




### Footnotes

[^1]: The last console I had was a PSOne (the big boxy version) from my uncle, and a Gameboy SP back in grade school. I did play some games casually (Final Fantasy Tactics Advance, and Pokemon Sapphire comes to mind), but not with a deeper appreciation that I have today.
[^2]: I still do some open-source work such as answering Issues and reviewing PRs, but sometimes you just want to take a break! The last open-source project I did was [Sprites-as-a-Service](/sprites-as-a-service), go check it out!
