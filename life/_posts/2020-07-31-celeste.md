**Prologue:** I've never been into video games when I was young.[^1] It didn't
occur to me that they can be subjects for serious thought or reflection.
However, the lockdowns forced me to find ways to fill my weekends without
programming.[^2] So I downloaded Steam, purchased my first few games &mdash;
*Terraria*, *Stardew Valley*, *Celeste* &mdash; and made the jump.

## Introduction: the first steps


[Celeste](http://www.celestegame.com/) is a charming platformer where you play
a character named Madeline, a young woman dead-set on climbing the top of the
titular Mountain.  Along the way she'll meet new friends, deal with her inner
demons, and survive the hazards beset her trail. 

Sure, it's *just* a game about climbing a mountain, but it triumphs by pulling
me in to the struggles of Madeline, and connecting it to my own experiences
without feeling forced. Celeste was able to achieve this with its (1) masterful
storytelling, (2) tight mechanics and gameplay, and (3) genius use of visuals
and sound. By seeing how these three were weaved together into a singular
*experience*, I developed a profound appreciation for this medium and saw its
potential for creative expression.

## Reach for the Summit

For the next three sections, I'll discuss how the narrative, mechanics, and
audio-visual techniques reinforce one another to form a cohesive experience.
This interplay made the game stand-out: nothing feels shoehorned-in. Everything
fits perfectly like a platforming puzzle.

### Masterful storytelling

Celeste's story is simple yet packed with an emotional undertone: Madeline, our
protagonist, wants to reach the peak of Celeste mountain. What makes it
masterful is on how it was able to make me empathize with Madeline, both
in-game and in real-life. 


It has a light-hearted exterior: I personally enjoy meeting the quirky
side-characters with their silly, gibberish, and garbled voices:

However, behind this cheerful backdrop lies a tale about anxiety, depression,
and the pressures of modern life (Marks, [2018](https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/01/25/celeste-review)). Madeline suffers from panic-attacks, drinks,
and gets stressed. In Chapter 2, she encounters her dark alternate, Badeline,
representing her insecurities, doubts, and fears. Throughout the game,
Badeline will taunt and chase me, culminating in an epic boss fight in Chapter
6.

<!-- Badeline chase scene -->

Her motivation for the climb, "to overcome and accomplish *something*," wasn't
made explicit, but I believe that it's intentional in order for us to project
our own goals and struggles as we play the game&mdash; and this is
where its genius lies.

<!-- Madeline quote scene -->


> Inasmuch as she [Madeline] wants to conquer Celeste the Mountain,
> metaphorically representing her fears and anxieties, I also want to conquer
> Celeste the game, and perhaps my own fears and anxieties too.

I empathize with Madeline because inasmuch as she wants to conquer Celeste the
Mountain, metaphorically representing her fears and anxieties, I also want to
conquer Celeste the game, and perhaps my own fears and anxieties too. This
two-fold interplay between in-game and real-life experience helped propel the
story forward. In some ways, I *am* Madeline; not only because I play her
character (her deaths and successes are my own), but also because I experience
her struggles and motivations. Her story does not end even after I close the
game or beat it. It continues to exist and grips me in this reality.

<!-- treating the subject delicately -->
Another thing that I like about Celeste's storytelling is on how it treated its
subject-matter delicately. It approached the topics of anxiety and depression with
kindness&mdash; not with an overly-pedantic tone. Acknowledging the innate
difficulty of precision-platformers, its message in the prologue is full of
hope: *"You can do this."*

<!-- You can do this screenshot -->

It never said "Hey, just talk to your friends!" or "Just do some meditation."
Instead, it presents you a heartwarming conversation with Theo, and a mini-game
about a golden feather.[^3] The golden feather scene which happened after
Chapter 4 is particularly special and caught me off-guard: it was a perfect
blend of gameplay, storytelling, and emotion on the topic of panic-attacks.

Because of that, the "conclusion" of Madeline's struggle is very well-earned. At
the start of Chapter 6, just a few more distance to the summit, she will
fall back to the start and is confronted by her dark side:

<!-- Madeline screenshot falling -->

By the end of Chapter 6 (and again, after an epic boss battle), Madeline realizes
that instead of running away from her doubts and anxieties as represented by
Badeline, she must learn how to work and function with it. This time around,
Madeline and Badeline will fuse, granting us the ability to double-dash, for
the final chapter to reach the summit. 

<!-- show double-dash GIF -->

The climb towards the summit isn't easy, even with the double-dash (it's a
culmination of all previous chapters' environmental mechanics made
difficult). However, the journey towards the summit shows that **dealing with
one's doubts and anxieties is a process**: we see Madeline and Badeline talk to
one another, and work towards their differences.

Celeste's storytelling is masterful because it enables us to empathize with the
main character's struggles, and it continues to live outside the game.
In addition, it was able to handle serious topics like anxiety and depression
responsibly. In the next section, we'll see how this tight storyline was made
more vibrant by weaving it through its intricate gameplay and solid mechanics.
Remember, Celeste is not a Telltale Adventure game, it's a hard-platformer
that demands creative problem-solving and precise inputs to overcome immense
difficulties.

### Footnotes

[^1]: The last console I had was a PSOne (the big boxy version) from my uncle, and a Gameboy SP back in grade school. I did play some games casually (Final Fantasy Tactics Advance, and Pokemon Sapphire comes to mind), but not with a deeper appreciation that I have today.
[^2]: I still do some open-source work such as answering Issues and reviewing PRs, but sometimes you just want to take a break! The last open-source project I did was [Sprites-as-a-Service](/sprites-as-a-service), go check it out!
[^3]: I later learned that the golden feather minigame was based from an actual [floating feather meditation technique](http://davidvago.bwh.harvard.edu/the-floating-feather-meditation-technique/). Someone replicated the [mini-game](https://github.com/FdelMazo/Feather) that you can try out (although I believe the experience will be more complete if you played the game)!
