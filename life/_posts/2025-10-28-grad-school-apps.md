<span class="firstcharacter">B</span>ack in 2021, I decided to embark on a PhD program and pursue an academic research career.
I knew I wanted to do research and had a strong feeling I'd enjoy academia.
However, it took me _four years_ to finally apply.
_What happened, and what took me so long?_
In this blog post, I want to reflect on the past four years&mdash;spanning multiple countries, jobs, and experiences.
The path was long and unconventional.
That journey is finally over, and now I'm on the cusp of another one.

This is not a "How to apply to grad school" blog post, but perhaps you'll find some nuggets of wisdom along the way.
If you want an actual guide, I recommend reading John Boaz Lee's [guide](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1N5ETwBh9dyLpxGRKIA9LXXJ_Jy44i1TP/view) (more Filipino context) or Tim Dettmer's [blog post](https://timdettmers.com/2018/11/26/phd-applications/) (realistic and quite sobering).

ðŸ“£ Finally, some news: I started my **PhD in Computation, Cognition, and Language** at the **University of Cambridge** this Fall!
I also got accepted to universities in the US and Canada, so this admissions cycle was truly a blessing.

### Prelude: the reality of CS grad school applications

As the fields of machine learning and NLP grow every year, the competition for top PhD programs has become increasingly fierce.
There was a time when I was looking at the newly-admitted PhD students here in the US, and it was common to see them with first-author publications in top conferences prior to their PhD.
One needs only to look at [these tweets](https://twitter.com/ShirleyYXWu/status/1876033230186615251?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) from professors and admissions committee members during the Fall 2025 cycle to recognize how competitive the CS PhD applications have been.

Although I had some industry experience with NLP projects from my previous consulting work back in 2021, I lacked the academic research background that seemed expected of PhD applicants.
Early on, I realized that pivoting from industry to academia would entail a lot of hard work.
A part of me thought that maybe I should have just continued to a PhD right after my Masters when the path seemed clearer.
But my industry years helped confirm that I genuinely enjoyed research work.

I could already imagine the challenges in this transition: relocating to another country, accepting a significant pay cut, and adjusting my life stages (e.g., getting married, starting a family) to align with a new career trajectory.
Looking back at 2021, I remember feeling overwhelmed by the self-imposed pressure to make everything fall perfectly into place.

### The long road to PhD applications

While working at [Explosion](https://explosion.ai), I was fortunate to be exposed to NLP research early on by working on our very first [technical report](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.09255) on hash embeddings.
This experience gave me the confidence to undertake my own independent work in Tagalog NLP, which led to [calamanCy](https://aclanthology.org/2023.nlposs-1.1.pdf) and [TLUnified-NER](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07161).
In addition, doing software engineering work on the [Prodigy annotation tool](https://prodigy.ai/) inspired my interest in researching data-centric approaches to NLP.

My time at Ai2 as a pre-doc was incredibly formative. 
Working alongside experienced researchers gave me a clearer picture of what academic research entailed and helped me identify the qualities I wanted to develop in myself as I grow into this career.
I was also lucky to be part of large collaborative projects like [T&uuml;lu 3](https://allenai.org/papers/tulu-3-report.pdf) and [OLMo 2](https://allenai.org/blog/olmo2) which gave me hands-on experience with frontier model post-training.

I got lucky because of the people who took chances on me, which is why I developed a mantra over time: **people over projects, projects over publications.**
I prioritize finding people whom I'm excited and energized to work with over specific projects&mdash;I believe that every topic is equally interesting given the right people.
During the four-year journey, I've been fortunate to collaborate with researchers from different places who shared my interests, particularly in multilingual NLP.
<!-- During the four-year journey, I've met folks from different places such as at SEACrowd and Cohere Labs who were great collaborators and were interested in the topics I care about. -->
<!-- I also met people who were equally interested in Filipino NLP, and I'm glad we made some projects together. -->
Everyone I worked with made me feel welcome, and I hope I can be that person for another aspiring researcher in the future.

My Masters professor, [Jinglu Hu](https://nclab.w.waseda.jp/jinglu/personal.html), also supported me all the way during my PhD applications.
He was happy to write me a recommendation letter, and I'm more than happy that he wrote it&mdash;it felt like things had gone full circle.
I have fond memories of Waseda back in 2016, and that time was formative in my career.

### On the admissions cycle

The admissions cycle spanned three months, from December to February, with the earliest deadline on December 4.
Because I also had to prepare for my wedding in December, I tried to finish all applications and essays by November.
I vividly recall arriving at the library as soon as it opened and remaining there until it closed.
The holiday season also brought a reflective mood, with fewer people around and a quieter atmosphere, I was able to reflect on what type of research I wanted to pursue.

I applied to 9 programs, and they're actually quite expensive!
I missed some of the fee waiver deadlines because I was busy, so I had to shell out $1,350 to $1,500 for application fees.
In addition, some universities require official TOEFL scores, so you also have to pay TOEFL fees in order to send your test results to those universities (~$35).
Don't make my mistake and keep in mind that fee waivers exist and most universities are generous, especially for international students, but just note that grad school apps can be very expensive.

{: style="text-align: center;"}


By January, I started receiving interview invites.
I had a mix of interview formats during this cycle: a research presentation, a short 15-20 minute informal chat, and a formal interview.
The last two weeks of January and the early weeks of February were the most intense, as they involved a lot of waiting and uncertainty.
I tried to keep myself busy, focusing on work and my current research projects&mdash; those were the longest two months I had ever experienced.

<!-- Another thing to note is that in Cambridge, acceptance to the program doesn't mean funding is guaranteed.
From what I understand, after your potential supervisor accepts you, they will forward your application to a funding committee, which then makes a separate decision to which scholarship you'll obtain.
This is unlike in the US or Canada (MILA) where a PhD offer already means a fully-funded PhD position.
Funding decisions for Cambridge often happens in March and April (sometimes extending to August!).
This means that I had to let go of other opportunities while waiting for funding&mdash; it was a pretty anxious time. -->

### Choosing PhD programs

One of the hardest challenges in entering a PhD is **balancing your career aspirations and future life plans.**
This is especially true for someone like me in their early 30s: a PhD program can take 4-6 years, pays poorly, and will coincide with the time when I might want to start a family.
Making this decision in my thirties is different from if I had made this decision during my twenties.
Getting into a PhD becomes a life decision more so than a career decision.

{: style="text-align: center;"}

Perhaps this is also the reason why some aspects that may be seen as disadvantages in a PhD program became *positives* for me. 
For example, there's a commonly held view that longer programs (6 years, as in the case of US PhDs) will give you more time for research, making you more productive, and, hence, more competitive by the time you graduate.
However, when I consider other factors outside of my career (e.g., starting a family, stability), shorter 4-year programs become more attractive.
This is just one of the many considerations, alongside research fit and potential opportunities after graduation.

A lot has been written on how to choose PhD programs (my favorite was [Tim Dettmer's post](https://timdettmers.com/2022/03/13/how-to-choose-your-grad-school)). 
In general, this is a good problem to have: several professors have taken a bet on you, and it's your turn to assess which program you see yourself in.
During one of my visit days, another prospective student told me that "choosing between offers is hard because now it's *real*."
There's definitely this fear of closing other doors and potential futures&mdash;what if you made the wrong choice?
It's a decision that will dictate the next four to six years, and maybe the rest of your academic career.
I just tell myself during those times that this was a good problem to have.

Although choosing a PhD program seems like a cerebral choice that entails a lot of calculus, a large part of my decision-making involved a lot of [discernment](https://www.ignatianspirituality.com/making-good-decisions/an-approach-to-good-choices/an-ignatian-framework-for-making-a-decision/).
Attuning myself to my [*desires*](https://godinallthings.com/2013/09/02/desire/) and praying over them helped a lot. 
One thing I've learned during this time is that **I can never make this decision with absolute certainty.**
Doubt will always be present, and I should welcome that.
Now that I'm past the hump of PhD applications, I'd like to give back: if you're a Filipino NLP researcher applying for a postgraduate degree abroad, I will help review your research statements.
In addition, if you're interested in doing research on Tagalog and Filipino NLP with the intention to publish, feel free to reach out, and I'm happy to mentor you!

### Final thoughts

It's October, and my wife and I have been here at Cambridge for a month.
There's a lot to say about Cambridge&mdash;the collegiate system, the traditions, the culture, and more.
Things still look unfamiliar, but I'm taking my time to let the place reveal itself to me, knowing that I'll be here for a while.

<!-- pictures of Cambridge! -->

I'm happy to close this chapter that lasted for four years.
I'm thankful to all the people who helped me along the way, as I've learned a lot about myself and who I wanted to be.
The path was long and winding, but I'm happy we made it.
The next few years will be equally exciting, but I just want to linger in this moment&mdash;that in-between space as you turn the page to another chapter.
_Padayon!_
