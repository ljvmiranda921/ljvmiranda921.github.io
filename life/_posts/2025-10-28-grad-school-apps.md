<span class="firstcharacter">B</span>ack in 2021, I decided I wanted to embark on a PhD program to pursue an academic research career.
I knew I wanted to do research and had a strong feeling I'll enjoy mentorship and teaching.
However, it took me _four years_ to finally apply.
_What happened, and what took me so long?_
In this blog post, I want to reflect on the past four years&mdash;spanning multiple countries, jobs, and experiences.
The path was long and unconventional.
That journey is finally over, and now I'm preparing myself on the cusp of another one.

This is not a "How to apply to grad school" blog post, but perhaps you'll find some nuggets of wisdom along the way.
If you want an actual guide, I recommend reading John Boaz Lee's [guide](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1N5ETwBh9dyLpxGRKIA9LXXJ_Jy44i1TP/view) (more Filipino context) or Tim Dettmer's [blog post](https://timdettmers.com/2018/11/26/phd-applications/) (realistic and quite sobering).

ðŸ“£ Finally, some news: I will be starting my **PhD in Computation, Cognition, and Language** at the **University of Cambridge** this Fall!
I also got accepted to several universities here in the US and Canada, so this admissions cycle was truly a blessing.
</p>

### Prelude: the reality of CS grad school applications

As the fields of machine learning and NLP grow every year, the **competition for top PhD programs has become increasingly competitive.**
There was a time when I was looking at the newly-admitted PhD students here in the US, and it's common to see them with first-author publications in top conferences prior to their PhD.
One just need to look at [these tweets](https://twitter.com/ShirleyYXWu/status/1876033230186615251?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) from professors and admissions committee (AdCom) members during the Fall 2025 cycle in order to recognize how competitive the CS PhD Applications have been.

Although I have worked on NLP-adjacent projects at [Thinking Machines (TM)](https://thinkingmachin.es/), I didn't have any academic NLP research experience in my profile back in 2021.
Early on, I realized that **pivoting from industry to academia will entail a lot of hard work.**
A part of me thought that maybe I should have just continued to PhD right after my Masters.
But in hindsight, my experience in the industry validated that (1) I still like doing research and that (2) I can always go back to industry if academia didn't pan out.

After my time in consulting, I discovered that my passion for research hadn't diminished&mdash;if anything, it had grown stronger.
While the transition from industry to academia might seem straightforward, the reality was far more complex.
It meant potentially relocating to another country, accepting a significant pay cut, and adjusting my life stages (e.g., getting married, growing a family) to align with a new career trajectory.
Looking back to 2021, I remember feeling overwhelmed by the self-imposed pressure to make everything fall perfectly into place.

### The long road to PhD applications

My first break into NLP research was in [spaCy](https://spacy.io), when Matt, Ines, and Sofie supported me in my research aspirations, which resulted in co-leading (with Akos!) our [hash-embeddings technical report](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.09255).
That experience opened up a lot of opportunities, like being able to collaborate with linguists like Anders S&oslash;gaard.
It also gave me the confidence to undertake my own independent work for Tagalog NLP, which led to [calamanCy](https://aclanthology.org/2023.nlposs-1.1.pdf) and [TLUnified-NER](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07161).
In addition, working with Magda and Vincent on incorporating LLMs in the [Prodigy annotation tool](https://prodigy.ai/) inspired my interest in researching data-centric approaches to NLP.

{: style="text-align: center;"}

At AI2, I was fortunate to be mentored by Pradeep, Yanai, and Yizhong.[^1]
My experience at AI2 shaped my research interests and solidified what type of researcher I want to be: earnest and competent.
I still remember when we were unable to submit our first project in time for a conference due to unexpected results, yet they remained supportive as we went back to the drawing board.
We then reframed the project and it became a better paper than before!
Later, they also trusted me to deliver the preference scaling aspect of the [T&uuml;lu 3](https://allenai.org/papers/tulu-3-report.pdf) and [OLMo 2](https://allenai.org/olmo) projects, which resulted in significant performance gains in our models&mdash; a contribution I'm proud to have accomplished last year.

<!-- Even after working on spaCy previously, I still felt like an outsider in the NLP research community, but they made me feel welcome.[^1]
Those small gestures meant a lot&mdash;and I hope I can be that person for another researcher in the future. -->

Inasmuch as I'd like to think that I got into PhD programs solely because of my efforts, I got lucky because of the people who took chances on me.
And so, I've developed a mantra over time: **people over projects, projects over publications.**
I prioritize finding people whom I'm excited and energized to work with over specific projects&mdash; I believe that every topic is equally interesting given the right people.
Everyone I worked with made me feel welcome, and I hope I can be that person to another aspiring researcher in the future.

During the four-year journey, I've met folks from [SIGSEA/SEACrowd/Grassroots](https://seacrowd.github.io/seacrowd-catalogue/contributors) (Holy, Samuel, Genta, Aji, Yong, Ruochen), the [Data Provenance Initiative](https://www.dataprovenance.org/) (Shayne), Filipino NLP (Joseph, Blaise, Ely, Conner, Ma'am Elsie, Angel), and even [Cohere for AI](https://cohere.com/research) (Srishti, Shayekh, Rishabh, Marzieh, Sebastian, Sara) who are great collaborators and luckily interested in the topics I care about.
More importantly, I also want to thank my Masters professor, [Jinglu Hu](https://nclab.w.waseda.jp/jinglu/personal.html), for inspiring me to pursue research.
He was happy to write me a recommendation letter and I'm more than happy that he wrote it&mdash; it felt like it went full circle.
I have fond memories of Waseda back in 2016, and that time was formative in my career.

> I think I've developed a mantra over time: people over projects, projects over publications.

Back then, I was also hung up on publications: I had this looming feeling that I always need to publish so I can keep up with the profiles of those _other folks_ accepted in top institutions.
Although this is still true in some way, now I prioritize projects and big-picture research directions.
By doing so, I can focus on which research projects I should say yes to.
This shift helped me focus on becoming a good researcher instead of trying to be the "perfect" PhD applicant.
I find that mindset more freeing&mdash; as I develop [a healthy detachment](https://www.ignatianspirituality.com/the-grace-of-detachment/) from my goals.

It took me years to build up a stronger portfolio, and even then I still thought my profile isn't strong enough when I was applying (it's easy to compare oneself to others, especially with this crazy competition).
But my wife encouraged me a lot and boosted my confidence.
**Surrounding myself with people who support me are important**, especially in academia, where each stage of your career is based on someone evaluating you, from PhD apps, journal/conference submissions, job applications, grants, etc.
And so, mustering myself, I applied to PhD programs in the US, UK, and Canada.

### On the admissions cycle

The admissions cycle spanned three months, from December to February, with the earliest deadline last December 4.
Because I also have to prepare for my wedding in December, I tried to finish all applications and essays by November.
I vividly recall arriving at the library as soon as it opens and remaining there until it closes.
The holiday season also brought a reflective mood, with fewer people around and a quieter atmosphere, I was able to reflect what type of research I wanted to pursue.

I applied for 9 programs, and it's actually quite expensive!
I missed some of the fee waiver deadlines because I was busy, so I had to shell out $1350 to $1500 for application fees.
In addition, some universities require official TOEFL scores, so you also have to pay TOEFL in order to send your test results to those universities (~$35).
Don't make my mistake and keep in mind that fee waivers exist and most universities are generous, especially for international students, but just note that grad school apps can be very expensive.

<!-- other pictures, i don't know which ones -->

By January, I started receiving interview invites.
I won't delve too much into this, because many guides have been written on how to prepare for interviews.
Let's just say I had a mix of interview formats during this cycle: a research presentation, a short 15-20 minute informal chat, and a formal interview.
The last two weeks of January and the early weeks of February were the most intense as it involved a lot of waiting and uncertainty.
I tried to keep myself busy, focusing on my current research and playing Kingdom Come Deliverance 2.

Another thing to note is that in Cambridge, acceptance to the program doesn't mean funding is guaranteed.
From what I understand, after your potential supervisor accepts you, they will forward your application to a funding committee, which then makes a separate decision to which scholarship you'll obtain.
This is unlike in the US or Canada (MILA) where a PhD offer already means a fully-funded PhD position.
Funding decisions for Cambridge often happens in March and April (sometimes extending to August!).
This means that I had to let go of other opportunities while waiting for funding&mdash; it was a pretty anxious time.
In the end, I got the prestigious [Harding Distinguished Postgraduate Scholarship](https://www.hardingscholars.fund.cam.ac.uk/), which solidified my choice to go to Cambridge.

### Choosing PhD programs

One of the hardest challenges in entering a PhD is **balancing your career aspirations and future life plans.**
This is especially true for me who is in my early 30s: a PhD program can take 4-6 years, pays low, and will coincide the time when I might want to start a family.
I spent the early months of 2023 communicating with my family and wife on how this decision would affect them.
Because of that, there was **pressure and anxiety to ensure that things move like clockwork**, but I've learned that I'm not alone in this journey&mdash; I have my family and friends along the way.

{: style="text-align: center;"}

These considerations factored in as to why I chose Cambridge.
For example, short PhD programs (3-4 years) became attractive.
Location took more priority, as I will uproot my wife and ensure she can work there and live comfortably.
Of course, the usual considerations came into play: advisor fit, research topic, university, etc.&mdash; which is another topic altogether!

Apart from these practical considerations, what helped me decide is asking myself this question: _will I be happy if I became successful in a certain path I chose?_
During the time I'm applying, LM reasoning and agents were the hottest topics, and so some of my potential advisors were interested in those.[^2]
Although there's undoubtedly a strong impact in working in those topics, I don't imagine myself happy as opposed to, say, improving equitability of NLP for language communities like mine (which I've been doing for Filipino since then).

Now that I'm past the hump of PhD applications, I'd like to give back: if you're a Filipino NLP researcher applying for a postgraduate degree abroad, I will help review your research statements!
In addition, if you're interested to do research on Tagalog and Filipino NLP with the intention to publish, feel free to reach out and I'm happy to mentor you!

### Final thoughts

We have been here at Cambridge for a month.
Things still look unfamiliar, but I'm taking my time to let the place reveal itself to me, knowing that I'll be here for some time.

<!-- pictures of Cambridge! -->

I'm happy to close this chapter that lasted for four years.
I'm thankful to all the people who helped me along the way, as I've learned a lot about myself and who I wanted to be.
The path was long and winding, but I'm happy we made it.
The next few years will be equally exciting, but I just want to linger in this moment, that in-between as you turn the page to another chapter.
_Padayon!_

### Footnotes

[^1]: There are many people in Ai2 who helped me of course: Valentina, Faeze, Nathan, Kyle R., Sachin, Maarten, Hannah and Noah (and much more)! It does take a village. I'm also thankful to Pradeep, Hanna+Yizhong who drafted my recommendation letters!

[^2]: It's reasonable to chase the hottest trends as grant-giving bodies and funding decisions tend to be biased around these topics.
