<span class="firstcharacter">M</span>y gaming life started when the pandemic hit
last year. Back then, I've only been playing single-player titles like
*Celeste*, *Hollow Knight*, and *Hades*. This year was no different: we still had lockdowns, 
new variants, and [Z]. [BECAUSE OF THAT] 
- less opportunities to meet with friends, socialize with new people, bond with gf (long-distance)
[Thesis statement: CO-OP GAMES SAVED MY 2021]

- started playing games back in 2020
- only singleplayer titles 
- 2020 was the pandemic, 2021 is no better: Philippines is lagging behind vaccinations, another variant went it etc.


1. emergent storytelling
- solves: you can't bond with them anymore, less shared memories
- bonding experience
- it's not: remember the time we stayed overnight at this diner? it's more remember that time we did X and Y

2. cooperation, not competition
- solves: 
- less sweaty, less salty
- more chill

3. fostered a non-toxic community
- meet other people
- i feel more secure, especially if you're with other people online (like you don't know them etc.)
