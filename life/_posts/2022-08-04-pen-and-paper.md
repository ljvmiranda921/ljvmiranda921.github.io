<span class="firstcharacter">O</span>bsidian, Notion, Evernote, I've tried them
all. With the deluge of note-taking and knowledge management apps everywhere, it
feels nice to go back to my desk, pick up a sheet of paper, grab my pen, and
start writing my thoughts down. There's a serene feeling whenever I work with
these *analog* tools, and it's a delightful complement to my software job.

In this blog post, I'll discuss why I enjoy working with my **"analog tools for
thought."**[^1] I'll talk about it in three dimensions&mdash;*simplicity*,
*intentionality*, and *historicity*. Note that this post isn't a slight to
digital apps and systems; I do use them, and they also embody the same
qualities, just executed differently. I hope this entices you to start putting
more intention when thinking with pen and paper.

## Simpler interface

First, I'd like to differentiate between tools and systems. *Tools* are
instruments to achieve something, and *systems* are the organization of such.
The table below illustrates this concept.

|         | Tools                                    | Systems                                                    |
|---------|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Analog Interface**  | Notebooks, pen, paper, sticky notes      | Bullet journaling, focus planners, *Zettelkasten* (slip-box) |
| **Digital Interface** | Obsidian, RoamResearch, Notion, Emacs org-mode, Notepad, Evernote | *Zettelkasten* (slip-box), productivity integrations, etc.   |


You can use the same system even if the tool is digital or analog.
[*Zettelkasten*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten) is a good example.
It started as a physical slip-box (pen and paper) and is now widely used in most
personal knowledge management (PKM) frameworks today. Systems can be
intrinsically complicated, and I argue that **using digital tools can compound
this complexity**.

Pen and paper is, *well*, pen and paper! There's just a one-to-one
correspondence between me and the tool. Sometimes, I find digital apps urging me
to integrate with another application or extension: connect to calendar, install
*this*, install *that* (and sure, it may also be my own *damn* fault). They
**force me to get into a "system"** rather than focus on what the tool provides.
It's overwhelming. Over-optimization leads to *empty work*, giving me **a
feeling of productivity in the absence of output**, [like
quicksand](https://twitter.com/kevinbaker/status/1433167944243159045?s=20&t=oNGbYy5v2Sr4KdQehebfew).
It hampers me from doing actual work.

The simplicity of pen and paper allows me to shape my system as I go along.
Mine's quite plain: an A5 notebook for work, a smaller notebook for
journalling, and a pen. I like to think of thoughts as **streaming
information**, so I don't need to tag and categorize them as we do with batched
data. Instead, using time as an index and sticky notes to mark slices of info
solves most of my use cases.

Graph notebooks like [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) think of information as
**batched data**. So you have a set of notes (samples) that you try to
aggregate, categorize, and connect.  Sure there's a use case for that: I can't
imagine a company wiki presented as streaming info!  But I don't think it aids
me in how I usually think. When thinking with pen and paper, I prefer managing
streamed information first, then converting it into batched information
later&mdash; a blog post, documentation, etc.


## Sparks intentionality

I find writing a **conscious effort**. There's physical exertion in each stroke:
my muscles tense, my fingers guide the pen, and I feel the friction as it
interacts with the paper. One thing that I appreciate when writing on paper is
that I feel more present. It signals my brain that this activity is not just
typing or writing, but thinking.

Sure, there are tradeoffs; sometimes, I think faster than I write, but I see
this as a feature: it forces me to **write down the salient aspects of my
thinking**. On the other hand, it's pretty easy to fall into
mindless writing when using a keyboard. It's even easier to fall into the
temptation of copy-pasting from the source material. The influx of information,
coupled with the convenience of note-taking apps, makes it easier to collect
rather than synthesize.

{:style="text-align: center;"}

Perhaps this is why *Zettelkasten* worked well during the time of physical
slip-boxes. Information was not cheap. You have to physically go to a library,
borrow some books, highlight important passages, and return them at the end of the day.
Sure, you can copy paragraphs word per word, but the physical exertion of
writing can tire you down. So instead, you'll paraphrase or synthesize that
information. It becomes a necessity than a guideline. When thinking with pen and
paper, I feel intentional.

Analog tools also allow me to **express my intention freely.** For example, when
using a blank notebook, I can write anywhere: begin from the bottom, on the
margins, or intersperse it with quick diagrams or illustrations. On the other
hand, note-taking apps usually force me to think line by line. It's not bad, but
it misses out on several affordances that pen and paper provides.

## Provides history

**Writing with ink captures more than words.** It captures my mood and my mistakes.
I remember in my college chemistry classes, we were instructed never to tear off
or hide any error we made in our lab notebooks. Instead, we should mark it with
a strikethrough. I brought this practice up to this day, and it's nice to see
the small corrections, marginalia, and scribbles representing the unrefined
parts of my thought process.

*I'm the only one who can read my penmanship.*
{:style="text-align: center;"}

It's fun to go back to my old notes and say: *"Oh, I was a little bit stressed
when I wrote this down."* There's an archival element in it that digital formats
cannot capture. Sure, it's a bit of a reach to say that my written notes are
better for preserving my thoughts&mdash;if they got lost or burned down, then it's
all gone. What I'm talking about here is **the written note's capacity to
encapsulate "what really happened"** during the time I thought about a particular
idea. In a text editor, everything is reduced to the same font, sterilizing
those details away.

I'll gladly pay for an application or service with the affordances of writing in
pen and paper while allowing me to back my notes up in the cloud. However, I
agree that **lifetime archival is a tradeoff I have to pay**.[^2] Lately, I've been
using a fountain pen with archival ink. This type of ink is waterproof and
ensures that my writing won't fade over time. Sometimes, I just don't let this
stress me out, and I opt for the inks I love and enjoy. My notes contain
streaming information, after all.

## Final thoughts

I wrote this blog post as **a love letter to my analog writing instruments.**
They're almost invisible; they're just there, helping me in my knowledge work.
Because of that, I may have spoken strongly against other digital systems--don't
raise your pitchforks; I use them too! Nowadays I use
[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) and [Zotero](https://zotero.org/); the latter a
by-product of my grad school days. However, I try to go against the common PKM
practices and I use them to bookmark information.

But in the end, the best thinking system is the one that works for you. I can't
really say if I've been more productive with pen and paper, I just find it more
frictionless and delightful, and *that's enough*. I also mentioned
*Zettelkasten* many times in this post, but I don't do that anymore&mdash;I just
did a 1-month dry run and it felt tiring. **Pen and paper just gives me the bare
essentials.** I can get straight to work and [not worry if something is a
literature note or a permanent
note](https://zettelkasten.de/posts/literature-notes-vs-permanent-notes/).

As an engineer, I love making things complicated (*winks*). You'll notice that
I'm using fountain pens with *this* ink, and a notebook with *that* paper-grade.
But the good thing about pen and paper is that these instruments are not
necessary. I do it because it's fun! And you don't have to (although trust me,
fountain pens changed my writing experience).

In the world of productivity porn, it sounds edgy to say "I use pen and paper."
I mean, it's just pen and paper! But if we're **optimizing for feelings**[^3],
I'll say that I find the most delight when thinking with pen and paper. I hope
you do too!

    I mention this with a tone of seriousness mixed with playful banter (tOoLs fOr tHoUgHt). I think
    the "tools for thought" space is essential; I believe in tools that help
    augment how we think and process information. However, I noticed that in recent
    years, we've been over-optimizing this process where tools became increasingly
    overwhelming to even facilitate knowledge work.

[^2]:

    And it's not that bad anymore! Whenever I take photos of my notes with my
    phone, it reliably detects the text (even with my penmanship) and saves them
    to the cloud.

    I stole the title from [this Substack
    post](https://browsercompany.substack.com/p/optimizing-for-feelings). I
    cannot put this much better than them: "we've chosen to optimize for
    feelings&mdash; to bring the quirks and edges of life back into software. To
    create something with soul." [Enjoyment is an important component of my day
