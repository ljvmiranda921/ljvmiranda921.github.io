This year, I've set myself a **personal goal of learning the Go programming
language**. However, learning a new language while maintaining a healthy
work/life balance[^1] is difficult. For starters, this is what I meant when I
said I want to learn Golang:

- Learn the code syntax and its proper idioms 
- Learn the production-level build toolchain
- Learn how to use the standard library effectively
- Learn how to use third-party libraries related to my domain
- ... and so much more!

That's definitely overwhelming, and given my current schedule and workload,
seems impossible to do in a short span of time. There are a lot of challenges
that I need to overcome:

1. Finding time to really focus on learning Go
2. Getting tangible results in my learning journey (a project, a tool, etc.)
3. Learn a new thing fast and deep without affecting my actual work

In this post, I'll talk about how I'm currently trying to solve these learning
challenges, and some of my **workarounds/tips on how to learn something new
while you're at work**.


## Time difference in grad school vs. industry

**My natural instict is to start a full-blown side-project.** This definitely
worked for me before: PySwarms taught me how to write prod-level Python,
Gym-Lattice became my platform for reinforcement learning, and this blog is a practice on
basic web development. However, I did all of these during grad school, where I
have all the time in the world. Back then, conversations like these can still
happen on a Sunday night:

```
# Wee hours of the night
>>> Me: Hmmm...what if I don't go to lab this week and focus on this nice
problem unrelated to my main research?
>>> (Also) Me: Sounds dope!

# After a week not showing to lab
>>> Me: Hey Professor, here's a cool thing I've tried last week! 
>>> Professor: Wow you're unproductive but ok! 
```

Well, those were not his actual words but [this totally
happened](https://www.dropbox.com/s/h4f5ybkn2bhssu7/lab2018applying.pdf?dl=0).
During grad school, I've been given the luxury of total freedom and control of
my time[^2]. I can definitely do whatever I want and enjoy (or suffer) because
of it. Our professor treats us like mature, independent adults who can manage
themselves well, so yeah, no handholding nor micromanagement.

This definitely is not the case in the industry&mdash; you can't just slack
off. To be fair, our company probably provides one of the most generous
learning packages in its industry: time-budgeting for learning endeavours, an
annual learning allowance, and multiple internal learning sessions with my
talented workmates. Thinking Machines has really spoiled us (and if you like
this you should definitely apply)! 

But yeah, unlike grad school, I can't just check myself out for a week and
expect my workmates and clients to be happy that I've done nothing
work-related; that means **I need to change my learning strategy**. 

## Same ends, different means

**I still want to have a tangible project built on Go.** This, for me, serves as a
proof-point that I can speak the language. It's like writing a Japanese essay
(even with some mistakes) just to prove you can speak Japanese[^3]. <!-- Write
about looking for potential projects but to no avail -->

Then one thing hit me: what if I tried learning Go, but *package it as doing
work?*. Turns out, **one of our engineers is working on some Slack automation
tool, and it's all written in Go!** I realized that I can contribute to that
project, and hit a lot of birds with one stone:

* I'm actually learning Go, and applying it to a production codebase.
* My code will be reviewed by someone who writes Go.
* I'm still working, because I'm adding value to the company.



### Footnotes

[^1]: Work/life balance for me is being able to achieve my professional goals/tasks while having an adequate amount of sleep (yes, sleep is important for me) and time for my family and side-projects. This means not working after 5pm, no work-related commits on Saturdays, and no commits on Sundays. 
[^2]: Ok, this depends on which stage of grad school you are on. After I've done all our course requirements, the last few sems were dedicated for research and lab work.
[^3]: For the record, I didn't do that.
