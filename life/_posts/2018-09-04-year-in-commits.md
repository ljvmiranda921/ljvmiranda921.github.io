As someone who's been working closely with software for the past two years, I'd
say in **git commits**:

{: style="text-align: center;"}

For those who aren't familiar with version-control systems, a git commit is
simply a log or savepoint in any software project. Each log keeps a history of
the things you've done. If there is a commit history of my usual day, it would
look like this:

* Cook breakfast and lunch
* Take a bath and dress up
* Go to work

For software projects, They usually look like this (from my project, [PySwarms](https://github.com/ljvmiranda921/pyswarms)):

* Add logging functionality in Reporter module
* Update documentation in sphinx
* Remove deprecated modules

The chart above shows how many logs I have done every single day for the past
year. It's not necessarily a measure of productivity, but you get the gist. 
Today, I'd like to talk about how a year in commits changed my perspective in
software, some lessons I've learned, and new challenges I'll set myself on for
the next year.

But first, let's have a brief tour of my year in commits:
