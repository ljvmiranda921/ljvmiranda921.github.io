    I started blogging back in 2017 while I was still a grad student. Six years
    passed, and I learned much about myself, my field, and my hobby. I want to

<span class="firstcharacter">I</span> don't remember the exact date I started my
blog. My [first commit](https://github.com/ljvmiranda921/ljvmiranda921.github.io/commit/5a107a575601952a5cbfea964cf9a23346b7fd20)
was January 17, 2017, but it may be older than that, as I squashed all my
commits in 2016 (I know, it's bad practice). I published my [first blog
post](/life/2017/01/16/hello-world/) on January 16, but I've been blogging in
Wordpress long before.  So I'll just take what's on the record&mdash; **January 16**
was the birth of this blog.

Six years! In the greater scheme of things, six years is just a pebble. People I
look up to, like [Simon Willison](https://simonwillison.net/2022/Jun/12/twenty-years/) and 
[Scott Hanselman](https://www.hanselman.com/blog/i-got-tired), have been blogging for
over twenty years. But I'll pat myself on the back: it is easy to start things,
but sticking to it for long periods of time is already an achievement.

I started this blog because I wanted  to record my tech journey. At first, I was
writing for myself. My initial posts were grad school assignments, notes from
online courses, and how-tos on technical problems. Then, when I started working
for a consulting firm, I wrote a few industry analyses and opinions. Now that
I'm working for an open-source library, I'm diving deep into linguistics and
NLP. You can definitely trace my career path through my [Notebook](/notebook/)! 

In this blog post, I want to talk about six lessons I learned from this journey.

## Consistency of output is proportional to input
