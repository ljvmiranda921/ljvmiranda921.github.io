<span class="firstcharacter">I</span> don't remember the exact date I started my
blog. My [first commit](https://github.com/ljvmiranda921/ljvmiranda921.github.io/commit/5a107a575601952a5cbfea964cf9a23346b7fd20)
was January 17, 2017, but it may be older than that, as I squashed all my
commits in 2016 (I know, it's bad practice). I published my [first blog
post](/life/2017/01/16/hello-world/) on January 16, but I've been blogging in
WordPress long before.  So I'll just take what's on the record&mdash; **January 16**
was the birth of this blog.

Six years! In the greater scheme of things, six years is just a pebble. People I
look up to, like [Simon Willison](https://simonwillison.net/2022/Jun/12/twenty-years/) and 
[Scott Hanselman](https://www.hanselman.com/blog/i-got-tired), have been blogging for
over twenty years. But I'll pat myself on the back: it is easy to start things,
but sticking to it for long periods of time is already an achievement.

I started this blog because [I wanted to record my tech journey](/about/). At
first, I was writing for myself. My initial posts were grad school assignments,
notes from online courses, and how-tos on technical problems. Then, when I
started working for a consulting firm, I wrote a few industry analyses and
opinions. Now that I'm working for an open-source library, I'm diving deep into
linguistics and natural language processing (NLP). You can definitely trace my
career path through my [Notebook](/notebook/)! 

In this blog post, I want to talk about six lessons I learned from this journey.

## 1. Consistency of output ‚àù input

I used to blog sporadically until 2021, when I decided to publish one blog post
per month. I thought that would be an easier cadence, for I have one month to
write something. However, by June, I was running out of ideas! So I was
scrambling for something to write, just any output, as long as I had something.
*Nothing came out.* Instead, I took the pressure off writing when I was in
between jobs: I focused on reading books, playing games, and bonding with
friends.

The following month, I was full of zest. Writing came easy, and my drafts flowed
like water. At that moment, I learned that if I want to be consistent with my
outputs, I need to be consistent with my inputs. The two are directly
proportional.

If we think of writing as a way to organize our thoughts, then there should be
thoughts to begin with. Writing is thinking. We collate these thoughts from
different inputs (books, newsletters, social media, etc.) and transform them
into something uniquely our own.

I also realized that my intake of information should go beyond quantity.
Subscribing to everything is easy but can also be counterproductive. So I
learned to curate what I consume. This led to some practices I developed over
time:
- **Have a backlog of ideas.** I use [Github Issues](https://github.com/ljvmiranda921/ljvmiranda921.github.io/issues) to keep track of random ideas I
come across from time to time. I'm also liberal in closing Issues I don't find
interesting anymore. 
- **Use RSS Readers and Twitter Lists.** I use [Inoreader](https://inoreader.com) to curate the content I
consume from the internet. The same goes for Twitter and Mastodon. Sometimes,
all I need is a chronological feed. Although social media recommendations help
with exploration, they are overwhelming.
- **Take notes!** I usually have [a notebook at hand](/life/2022/08/04/pen-and-paper/) to process insights and
"rehearse" blog posts. My prompt usually goes like this: "If I write a blog post
about this topic, what would be the title? What will be the headers?"

These practices instilled the idea that the act of writing happens before I open
my text editor. It also shows how integral writing (or blogging) is in my
thinking process. The quality of my outputs is proportional to the quality of my
inputs.

## One for me, one for them

## Think about readers who skim 

- visuals
- headers

## Don't hit publish right away!

## Marketing starts before writing

- keywords

## Throw drafts that don't spark joy

## Final thoughts
