<span class="firstcharacter">O</span>bsidian, Notion, Evernote, I've tried them
all. With the deluge of note-taking and knowledge management apps everywhere, it
feels nice to go back to my desk, pick up a sheet of paper, grab my pen, and
start writing my thoughts down. There's a serene feeling whenever I work with
these *analog* tools, and it's a delightful complement to my software job.

In this blog post, I'll discuss why I enjoy working with my **"analog tools for
thought."**[^1] I'll talk about it in three dimensions&mdash;*simplicity*,
*intentionality*, and *historicity*. Note that this post isn't a slight to
digital apps and systems; I do use them, and they also embody the same
qualities, just executed differently. I hope this entices you to start putting
more intention when thinking with pen and paper.

## Simpler interface

First, I'd like to differentiate between tools and systems. *Tools* are
instruments to achieve something, and *systems* are the organization of such.
The table below illustrates this concept.

|         | Tools                                    | Systems                                                    |
|---------|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Analog Interface**  | Notebooks, pen, paper, sticky notes      | Bullet journaling, focus planners, *Zettelkasten* (slip-box) |
| **Digital Interface** | Obsidian, RoamResearch, Notion, Emacs org-mode, Notepad, Evernote | *Zettelkasten* (slip-box), productivity integrations, etc.   |


You can use the same system even if the tool is digital or analog.
[*Zettelkasten*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten) is a good example.
It started as a physical slip-box (pen and paper) and is now widely used in most
personal knowledge management (PKM) frameworks today. Systems can be
intrinsically complicated, and I argue that **using digital tools can compound
this complexity**.

Pen and paper is, *well*, pen and paper! There's just a one-to-one
correspondence between me and the tool. Sometimes, I find digital apps urging me
to integrate with another application or extension: connect to calendar, install
*this*, install *that* (and sure, it may also be my own *damn* fault). They
**force me to get into a "system"** rather than focus on what the tool provides.
It's overwhelming. Over-optimization leads to *empty work*, giving me **a
feeling of productivity in the absence of output**, [like
quicksand](https://twitter.com/kevinbaker/status/1433167944243159045?s=20&t=oNGbYy5v2Sr4KdQehebfew).
It hampers me from doing actual work.

The simplicity of pen and paper allows me to shape my system as I go along.
Mine's quite plain: an A5 notebook for work, a smaller notebook for
journalling, and a pen. I like to think of thoughts as **streaming
information**, so I don't need to tag and categorize them as we do with batched
data. Instead, using time as an index and sticky notes to mark slices of info
solves most of my use cases.

<!-- picture of midori with different numbers -->

Graph notebooks like [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) think of information as
**batched data**. So you have a set of notes (samples) that you try to
aggregate, categorize, and connect.  Sure there's a use case for that: I can't
imagine a company wiki presented as streaming info!  But I don't think it aids
me in how I usually think. When thinking with pen and paper, I prefer managing
streamed information first, then converting it into batched information
later&mdash; a blog post, documentation, etc.

## Sparks intentionality

## Provides history



[^1]:

    I mention this with a tone of seriousness mixed with playful banter (tOoLs fOr tHoUgHt). I think
    the "tools for thought" space is essential; I believe in tools that help
    augment how we think and process information. However, I noticed that in recent
    years, we've been over-optimizing this process where tools became increasingly
    overwhelming to even facilitate knowledge work.
