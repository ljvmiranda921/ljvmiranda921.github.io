    With the world inundated with productivity apps, it feels nice to return to
    the tried and tested pen-and-paper methods.  In this blog post, I'll share
    my analog "tools for thought" and talk about why I prefer them over digital

<span class="firstcharacter">O</span>bsidian, Notion, Evernote, I've tried them
all. With the deluge of note-taking and knowledge management apps everywhere, it
feels nice to go back to my desk, pick up a sheet of paper, grab my pen, and
start writing my thoughts down. There's a serene feeling whenever I work with
these *analog* tools, and it's a delightful complement to my software job.

In this blog post, I'll discuss why I enjoy working with my **"analog tools for
thought."**[^1] I'll talk about it in three dimensions&mdash;*simplicity*,
*intentionality*, and *historicity*. Note that this post isn't a slight to
digital apps and systems; I do use them, and they also embody the same qualities
(just executed differently). I hope this entices you to start putting more
intention when thinking with pen and paper.


## Simpler interface

First, I'd like to differentiate between tools and systems. *Tools* are
instruments to achieve something, and *systems* are the organization of such.
The table below illustrates this concept.

|         | Tools                                    | Systems                                                    |
|---------|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| Analog Interface  | Notebooks, pen, paper, sticky notes      | Bullet journaling, focus planners, *Zettelkasten* (slip-box) |
| Digital Interface | Obsidian, RoamResearch, Notion, Emacs org-mode, Notepad | *Zettelkasten* (slip-box), productivity integrations, etc.   |


You can use the same system even if the tool is digital or analog.
[*Zettelkasten*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten) is a good example.
It started as a physical slip-box (pen and paper) and is now widely used in most
personal knowledge management (PKM) frameworks today. Systems can be
intrinsically complicated, and I argue that **using digital tools can compound
this complexity**.



## Sparks intentionality

## Provides history



[^1]:

    I mention this with a tone of seriousness mixed with playful banter (tOoLs fOr tHoUgHt). I think
    the "tools for thought" space is essential; I believe in tools that help
    augment how we think and process information. However, I noticed that in recent
    years, we've been over-optimizing this process where tools became increasingly
    overwhelming to even facilitate knowledge work.
