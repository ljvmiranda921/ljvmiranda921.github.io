<span class="firstcharacter">O</span>bsidian, Notion, Evernote, I've tried them
all. With the deluge of note-taking and knowledge management apps everywhere, it
feels nice to go back to my desk, pick up a sheet of paper, grab my pen, and
start writing my thoughts down. There's a serene feeling whenever I work with
these *analog* tools, and it's a delightful complement to my software job.

In this blog post, I'll discuss why I enjoy working with my **"analog tools for
thought"**[^1]. I'll talk about it in three dimensions&mdash;*simplicity*,
*intentionality*, and *historicity*. Note that this post isn't a slight to
digital systems; I do use them, and they also embody the same qualities (just
executed differently). I hope this entices you to start putting more intention
*when thinking with pen and paper.

## Why I love thinking with pen and paper



[^1]:

    I mention this with a tone of seriousness mixed with playful banter. I think
    the "tools for thought" space is essential; I believe in tools that help
    augment how we think and process information. However, I noticed that in recent
    years, we've been over-optimizing this process where tools became increasingly
    overwhelming to even facilitate knowledge work.
