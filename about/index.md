Hi friends! My name is Lj Miranda, and welcome to my website! 

I [build things](https://github.com/ljvmiranda921).

I started this site to tell the story of my tech journey. I believe in
**technology that is open, enabling, and life-giving**. I aspire to usher that
potential&mdash;even for just a tiny bit. But, there is still a long way to go,
and this site records my progress. 

Here, you'll find some of my **thoughts, works, and notes** on software
development, machine learning, and research. I hope you'll spend a nice time
here, so go grab yourself a coffee and feel free to look around!

## Background

I'm a [Predoctoral Young
Investigator](https://allenai.org/predoctoral-young-investigators) at the [Allen
Institute for Artificial Intelligence (AI2)](https://allenai.org) as part of the
[AllenNLP team](https://allenai.org/allennlp). Previously, I've worked at the
following places:

* [Explosion](https://explosion.ai) (Berlin): a natural language processing
    startup where I worked on the 
    open-source [spaCy](https://spacy.io) library and the
    [Prodigy](https://prodi.gy) annotation tool. I co-authored our [first technical
    report](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.09255) and developed several features and
    projects for our software libraries.
    
* [Thinking Machines Data Science](https://thinkingmachin.es) (Manila): a data 
    science consultancy where I built multiple natural language processing
    products for large enterprises. I worked with several of our biggest clients
    in Southeast Asia and led teams in the Document AI space.

* [Preferred Networks](https://www.preferred-networks.jp/en/) (Tokyo): as an
    intern, I implemented a training parallelization framework for
    [ChainerRL](https://github.com/chainer/chainerrl), an open-source
    reinforcement learning library.

I obtained my master's degree from [Waseda
University](https://www.waseda.jp/top/en) and my bachelor's in Electronics
Engineering, minor in Philosophy from [Ateneo de Manila
University](https://www.ateneo.edu). I used to be a bioinformatics researcher
but moved on to language&mdash; text, like proteins, are sequences after all. My
research interests include **low-resource and multilingual NLP**, **efficient
NLP**, and **corpus linguistics**.

Lastly, I'm well-involved in open-source and have authored [several
projects](https://github.com/ljvmiranda921) of my own.
[Pyswarms](https://github.com/ljvmiranda921/pyswarms) has been quite
successful; I've seen it being used in [quantum
physics](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.07686),
[chemistry](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acscentsci.8b00307), and
[teaching](https://www.gousios.gr/courses/algo-ds/optimizations.html), amongst
[other
things](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&cites=15267041073198929167).
I love indie games and [dabble in game
development](https://ljvmiranda921.itch.io) using [Pico-8](https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php) and
[Godot](https://godotengine.org/).

<b>Short background</b><br>
Lj Miranda specializes in natural language processing with over five years of
experience in consulting, open-source development, and research. He helped
maintain notable open-source libraries such as spaCy and Pyswarms. He dabbles
in game development during his free time.
