Hi friends, my name is Lj Miranda and welcome to my blog! 

I [build things](https://github.com/ljvmiranda921).

I started this site to tell the story of my tech journey. I believe in
**technology that is open, enabling, and life-giving**. I aspire to usher that
potential&mdash;even for just a tiny bit.  There is still a long way to go, and
this site records my progress. 

Here, you'll find some of my **thoughts, works, and notes** on software
development, systems, machine learning, and research. I hope that
you'll spend a nice time here, so go grab yourself a cup of coffee and feel
free to look around! 

P.S. I also have a monthly newsletter, the [Purveyor of Curiosities](https://ljvmiranda.substack.com/)! Know more and subscribe [here](/subscribe). 


## Background

I'm currently taking some time-off to rest, refresh, and recharge.

Prior to that, I've worked for some machine learning startups such as:
* [Thinking Machines Data Science](https://thinkingmachin.es) (Manila), where I built
    multiple natural-language processing and computer-vision ML products such as a search engine, an industry
    classifier, and a document OCR system to name a few.
* [Preferred Networks](https://www.preferred-networks.jp/en/) (Tokyo) as an
    intern, where I implemented a training parallelization framework for
    [ChainerRL](https://github.com/chainer/chainerrl), an open-source
    reinforcement learning library.

I obtained my master's degree from [Waseda
University](https://www.waseda.jp/top/en) and my bachelor's in Electronics
Engineering, minor in Philosophy from [Ateneo de Manila
University](https://www.ateneo.edu). My current research interests include
machine learning systems design, natural-language processing, and artificial
life. 

Lastly, I'm well-involved in open-source and have authored [several
projects](https://github.com/ljvmiranda921) of my own.
[Pyswarms](https://github.com/ljvmiranda921/pyswarms) has been quite
successful, I've seen it being used in [quantum
physics](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.07686),
[chemistry](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acscentsci.8b00307), and
[teaching](https://www.gousios.gr/courses/algo-ds/optimizations.html) amongst
[other
things](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&cites=15267041073198929167).
I love indie games and dabble in game
development using [PICO-8](https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php) and
[Godot](https://godotengine.org/).
