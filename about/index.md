Hi friends, my name is Lj Miranda and welcome to my blog! 

I like [building things](https://github.com/ljvmiranda921).

I started this site to tell the story of my tech journey. I believe in
**technology's enabling power, especially in developing countries like the
Philippines**. I aspire to usher that potential&mdash;even for just a tiny bit.
There is still a long way to go, and this site records my progress. 

Here, you'll find some of my **thoughts, works, and notes** on software
development, data science, machine learning, and research. I hope that
you'll spend a nice time here, so go grab yourself a cup of coffee and feel
free to look around! 

## Background

I'm currently a Machine Learning Researcher at [Thinking
Machines](https://thinkingmachin.es/), a data science startup in the
Philippines.

Prior to that, I obtained my Masters degree from [Waseda
University](https://www.waseda.jp/top/en), where I did some research on protein
function prediction using unsupervised learning techniques. Before graduation,
I spent the summer as an intern at [Preferred
Networks](https://www.preferred-networks.jp/en/), an AI startup in Japan.
During that time I worked on a reinforcement learning library called
[ChainerRL](https://github.com/chainer/chainerrl), where I implemented a
training parallelization framework.  Further back, I received my undergraduate
degree in Electronics Engineering (*cum laude*) and a minor in Philosophy from
[Ateneo de Manila University](https://www.ateneo.edu). 

I'm interested in problems concerning machine learning and its
applications, especially those that deal with its deployment, engineering, and
use. Furthermore, I want to understand more the role of technology in
underserved communities (and developing countries), and how it affects our
lives as a whole. 

Lastly, I'm well-involved in open-source and have some projects of my own:
[PySwarms](https://github.com/ljvmiranda921/pyswarms), a particle swarm
optimization toolkit in Python, and
[Gym-Lattice](https://github.com/ljvmiranda921/gym-lattice), a reinforcement
learning library for protein folding. PySwarms has been more successful, I've
seen it being used in [quantum physics](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.07686),
[chemistry](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acscentsci.8b00307), and
[teaching](http://gousios.org/courses/algo-ds/book/string-distance.html#sop-example-using-pyswarms).
I also contribute to other projects such as scikit-multilearn, scikit-plot, and
chainerrl.
