Hi friends! My name is Lj Miranda, and welcome to my blog! 

I [build things](https://github.com/ljvmiranda921).

I started this site to tell the story of my tech journey. I believe in
**technology that is open, enabling, and life-giving**. I aspire to usher that
potential&mdash;even for just a tiny bit. But, there is still a long way to go,
and this site records my progress. 

Here, you'll find some of my **thoughts, works, and notes** on software
development, machine learning, and research. I hope you'll spend a nice time
here, so go grab yourself a coffee and feel free to look around! 

If you don't know where to start, then check out [this curated list](/highlights/)!

## Background

I'm a Machine Learning Engineer at [Explosion](https://explosion.ai). I help
develop [spaCy](https://spacy.io) and related open-source projects. Previously,
I've worked for some machine learning startups such as:
* [Thinking Machines Data Science](https://thinkingmachin.es) (Manila): a data 
   science consultancy where I built multiple natural language processing and
   computer vision products, including a a search engine, an industry classifier,
   and a document processing system to name a few.
* [Preferred Networks](https://www.preferred-networks.jp/en/) (Tokyo): as an
    intern, where I implemented a training parallelization framework for
    [ChainerRL](https://github.com/chainer/chainerrl), an open-source
    reinforcement learning library.

I obtained my master's degree from [Waseda
University](https://www.waseda.jp/top/en) and my bachelor's in Electronics
Engineering, minor in Philosophy from [Ateneo de Manila
University](https://www.ateneo.edu). My research interests include machine
learning systems design and natural language processing. 

Lastly, I'm well-involved in open-source and have authored [several
projects](https://github.com/ljvmiranda921) of my own.
[Pyswarms](https://github.com/ljvmiranda921/pyswarms) has been quite
successful; I've seen it being used in [quantum
physics](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.07686),
[chemistry](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acscentsci.8b00307), and
[teaching](https://www.gousios.gr/courses/algo-ds/optimizations.html), amongst
[other
things](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&cites=15267041073198929167).
I love indie games and [dabble in game
development](https://ljvmiranda921.itch.io) using [Pico-8](https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php) and
[Godot](https://godotengine.org/).
