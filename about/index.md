Hi friends, my name is Lj Miranda and welcome to my blog! 

I [build things](https://github.com/ljvmiranda921).

I started this site to tell the story of my tech journey. I believe in
**technology that is open, enabling, and life-giving**. I aspire to usher that
potential&mdash;even for just a tiny bit.  There is still a long way to go, and
this site records my progress. 

Here, you'll find some of my **thoughts, works, and notes** on software
development, systems, machine learning, and research. I hope that
you'll spend a nice time here, so go grab yourself a cup of coffee and feel
free to look around! 

## Background

I'm currently a Machine Learning Researcher at [Thinking
Machines](https://thinkingmachin.es/), a data science consultancy in the
Philippines.

Prior to that, I obtained my Masters degree from [Waseda
University](https://www.waseda.jp/top/en), where I did some research on protein
function prediction using unsupervised learning techniques. Before graduation,
I spent the summer as an intern at [Preferred
Networks](https://www.preferred-networks.jp/en/), an AI startup in Japan.
During that time I worked on a reinforcement learning library called
[ChainerRL](https://github.com/chainer/chainerrl), where I implemented a
training parallelization framework.  Further back, I received my undergraduate
degree in Electronics Engineering (*cum laude*) and a minor in Philosophy from
[Ateneo de Manila University](https://www.ateneo.edu). 

I'm interested in problems concerning machine learning and its applications,
especially those that deal with its deployment, engineering, and use.
Furthermore, I'm also learning about distributed systems and infrastructure. 

Lastly, I'm well-involved in open-source and have some projects of my own:
[PySwarms](https://github.com/ljvmiranda921/pyswarms), a particle swarm
optimization toolkit in Python, and
[Gym-Lattice](https://github.com/ljvmiranda921/gym-lattice), a reinforcement
learning library for protein folding. PySwarms has been more successful, I've
seen it being used in [quantum physics](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.07686),
[chemistry](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acscentsci.8b00307), and
[teaching](http://gousios.org/courses/algo-ds/book/string-distance.html#sop-example-using-pyswarms).
I also contribute to other projects such as scikit-multilearn, scikit-plot, and
chainerrl.
