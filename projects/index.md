Here are some of the non-trivial projects I built for the past few years.
My definition of a *project* is a bit fuzzy; for now, these are things that I
have worked (or have been working) on for more than three months.

<ul>
  {% for post in site.categories.projects %}
    <li>
        <span>{{ post.date | date_to_string }}</span> Â» <a href="{{ post.url }}" title="{{ post.title }}">{{ post.title }}</a>
        <meta name="description" content="{{ post.summary | escape }}">
        <meta name="keywords" content="{{ post.tags | join: ', ' | escape }}"/>
    </li>
  {% endfor %}
</ul>
