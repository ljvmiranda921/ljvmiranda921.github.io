For the past few weeks, I've started an open-source project in Python by building a research toolkit
for Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). PSO is a heuristic search algorithm that was inspired by the
social dynamics of birds and bees. What made me interested in PSO is that it tries to simulate group
behavior when faced with a certain objective, something that can also be observed in humans. Furthermore,
the standard algorithm is simple, and can be used in a variety of applications.

## Inspiration

If one is to look at published literature, there is a multitude of variations in the standard
PSO algorithm, all of these being applied in different situations. It then becomes hard for researchers
to benchmark their results because there's no unified framework to do it. Hopefully, a standard library
should exist for implementing not only the classic PSO algorithms, but also the state-of-the-art variations
in literature.  

In addition, I found some of the current implementations a bit lacking. [tisimst's](https://github.com/tisimst/pyswarm)
work, although useful, is not extensible and works only on one type of problem (although I named my project
with respect to theirs). On the other hand [PyGMO](http://esa.github.io/pygmo/) and [DEAP](https://github.com/DEAP/deap),
although mature, are more generalized to evolutionary computation algorithms.

## Features

I realized that if I am to build an optimization library, it must have three important features: (1) the
user-facing API must be easy-to-use, that is, an optimization can already be done in less than 5-8 lines
of code, (2) supporting utilities must be included to assess optimizer performance, and (3) the programming
API must be highly-extensible. These three are the guiding principles when I built PySwarms.

### Easy-to-use optimization tool

This feature is highly important especially for users who just wanted a quick-and-easy optimization process.
I hope that this can minimize "frustration" in setting up various configurables and the like. For example,
if we want to find the minima of a sphere function using global-best PSO, we only need to import the
`pyswarms.single.GlobalBestPSO` class and the built-in `pyswarms.utils.functions.single_obj` module to
do optimization:

```python
# Import PySwarms
import pyswarms as ps
from pyswarms.utils.functions import single_obj as fx

# Set-up hyperparameters
options = {'c1': 0.5, 'c2': 0.3, 'w':0.9}
# Call instance of PSO
optimizer = ps.single.GlobalBestPSO(n_particles=10, dimensions=2, options=options)
# Perform optimization
cost, pos = optimizer.optimize(fx.sphere_func, print_step=100, iters=1000, verbose=2)
```

Excluding the comments and spaces, it only takes five lines to perform optimization. Compare this to
[DEAP's implementation](http://deap.readthedocs.io/en/master/overview.html). Although in all fairness,
DEAP can be seen as a lower-level computational tool than what PySwarms is aspiring to be.

More examples can be seen at the [documentation](https://pyswarms.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/usecases.html).

### Supporting utilities to assess optimizer performance

Enhancements such as support-utilties are very important in assessing swarm behavior and optimizer
performance. As of now, a `PlotEnvironment` class is implemented to perform such tasks. The idea is
to pass the optimizer in this environment in order to call various methods such as `plot_cost()` or
`plot_particles2D()`. The visualization tool is built on top of Matplotlib in order to provide
deeper customizability to the plots.

However, the default settings are already decent. Consider the same example as above as we pass it in
the plot environment:

```python
# Import PySwarms
import pyswarms as ps
from pyswarms.utils.functions import single_obj as fx
from pyswarms.utils.environments import PlotEnvironment

# Create optimizer
options = {'c1':0.5, 'c2':0.3, 'w':0.9}
optimizer = ps.single.GlobalBestPSO(n_particles=10, dimensions=3, options=options)

# Pass to plot environment
plt_env = PlotEnvironment(optimizer, fx.sphere_func, 1000)
```

From this we can call various methods already. If we call `plot_cost()`, then we can obtain a plot
similar to the one below

__Figure 1:__ _Calling the `plot_cost()` method generates a cost history line plot._

More so, we can even animate swarm movement. Recall that we are using a Global-best PSO algorithm,
where each particle compares itself with the best-performing particle in the group. Notice in the
figure below how these particles converge on the global-best at position `(0,0,0)`. To generate
a 3-d animation, we just need to call the `plot_particles3D()` method.

### Highly-extensible API

I think that it is important to build an easy to use API for researchers an contributors who wanted
to implement their own techniques or add new features. Honestly, this has become a challenge for myself,
being new in the open-source field. I'm still iterating my base classes but I'm confident that most of
these are now extensible as I've imagined.

The main idea for this is to inherit from base classes in order to implement new techniques. Most of the
development time goes to the base classes, making sure that they are applicable in the most general sense.
These include an array of getters, attributes, and abstract methods that I deem universal in most PSO
implementations. Thus, if one is to observe the implementations on `pyswarms.single.GlobalBestPSO` and
`pyswarms.single.LocalBestPSO`, not much redundancy exists between the two.

The main idea for implementing an optimizer can be seen in this [guide](https://pyswarms.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contributing.optimizer.html). You can also view the API
documentation [here](https://pyswarms.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/pyswarms.html).

## Tutorials

I wrote some accompanying tutorials on using PySwarms, most of these include use-cases on where to
use Particle Swarm Optimization in some problems, and how PySwarms can make the implementations much
easier. They are all in the documentation, but I will list some of them here:

* [Training a neural network classifier](https://pyswarms.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/train_neural_network.html)
* [Feature subset selection](https://pyswarms.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/feature_subset_selection.html)
