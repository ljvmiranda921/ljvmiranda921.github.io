<span class="firstcharacter">A</span>t the end of 2024, I wrote about my [desiderata for Filipino NLP](/notebook/2024/12/17/filipino-llm/).
One of which was **evaluation**.
I said that most of "how we measure LLM capabilities in Filipino are anecdotal: we post a screenshot of ChatGPT writing in Filipino and claim that it alredy has that capability&mdash;we need a systematic approach to evaluating these models."
Fast forward to today, I'm happy that we are now inching towards systematic evaluations for Filipino.

Without further ado, I introduce **FilBench**, an LLM Evaluation Suite for Filipino!

## Why do we need FilBench?

#### FilBench fills the need for systematic evaluations for Filipino


#### We need more language-specific benchmarks




## What's unique about FilBench?

<!-- I am excited to see that the timing of my [*Desiderata* blog post](/notebook/2024/12/17/filipino-llm/) was on point: after posting it, I saw the release of several benchmarks that target LLM capabilities on Filipino (or Southeast Asian language) capabilities.
Notable examples include [SEA-HELM](), and its Tagalog subset, [Batayan]().
This shows that the research pulse right now is on evaluation.

Compared to these benchmarks, FilBench aims to be more opinionated on what it's testing.
We start by taking stock of what many Filipino NLP researchers are evaluating pre-GPT language models upon, and creating a taxonomy of capabilities consisting of Classical NLP, Cultural Knowledge, Reading Comprehension, and Generation. -->

## A Grassroots Effort

<!-- One thing that's really exciting about building FilBench is that I'm like assembling the Avengers of Filipino NLP.
It actually started with just the three of us&mdash; Ely, Conner, and I&mdash; working on the [Data Is Better Together annotation project](https://github.com/huggingface/data-is-better-together) from HuggingFace.
I've met them separately through other projects like [SEACrowd](https://seacrowd.github.io/) and earlier correspondences. -->




## What's next?
