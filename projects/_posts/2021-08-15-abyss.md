<span class="firstcharacter">L</span>ast May, I published my first game on
[itch.io](https://ljvmiranda921.itch.io).
**[Abyss](https://ljvmiranda921.itch.io/abyss) is an action roguelike that
takes you into the depths as you battle monsters and foes!** *Who lurks deep
beneath? Find out here:*

I shared it to my friends and some game dev communities. They all complimented
the gameplay, enjoyed the choice of music, and loved the art style. Their
feedback made my entire year! It feels good to work on something, sharing it
out in the open, and receiving good reactions from it.

In this blogpost, I'll talk about **five lessons I learned from making my first
game.** As it turns out, game development is a different beast! Even though I've been
programming professionally for three years now, there are lessons I've still
come to learn.

1. [Limit your scope](#1-limit-your-scope)
2. [Set a schedule and stick to it](#2-set-a-schedule-and-stick-to-it)
3. [Play with your strengths](#3-play-with-your-strengths)
4. [Join a community of like-minded folks](#4-join-a-community-of-like-minded-folks)
5. [Don't forget to have fun!](#5-dont-forget-to-have-fun)

I highly recommend **playing the game first before reading** the rest of the
post.  I'll talk about few design decisions that may be considered as *spoiler*
even if it's just a small game.


## 1. Limit your scope

As a famous saying goes: "your first ten games will suck, so get them out of
the way fast."[^1] For me, it stresses the importance of shipping, and **the
enemy of shipping is scope creep.** I want to finish a game and move on to the
next one.

> Your first ten games will suck, so get them out of the way fast

I work well with deadlines, so I gave myself ten weekends with two weeks of
buffer (approximately three months). I also want to keep it simple, yet rich in
variety. Given that timeframe, I kept my expectations low: I won't be making
the next AAA hit, **so my goal is to simply "make a game that I will be delighted to
play."**

> My goal: make a game that I myself will be delighted to play.

This led to my decision to create a roguelike.[^2] Looking back, I benefited
from this choice because:

* *I can piggyback on procedural generation:* I get a lot of variety for free.
* *It's tile-based:* no need to write physics, just simple four-directional motion.
* *It's almost infinitely replayable:* because of permadeath, I can focus on
    the core gameplay.

**Figure**: Three-act structure for my roguelike
{: style="text-align: center;"}

In addition, I chose roguelikes because I've been playing that genre for the
past few months. [Hades](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1145360/Hades/), [Dead
Cells](https://deadcells.fandom.com/wiki/Fatal_Falls_DLC), and [Slay the
Spire](https://store.steampowered.com/app/646570/Slay_the_Spire/) became my
inspiration. As for content, I restricted myself into three acts and one
final boss. It's good enough to keep the scope tiny and content rich, while
establishing an end state. 

With the scope set, it's time to build!

## 2. Set a schedule and stick to it

My game won't create itself, so **I spent the weekends writing code and making
art.** Keeping a schedule forced me to be consistent, which in turn allowed short
feedback loops. It also built momentum to finish the game.

One practice I found useful is participating in
[#screenshotsaturdays](https://twitter.com/hashtag/screenshotsaturdays), i.e.,
to post a screenshot of my progress on Twitter every weekend. It's good for
pacing: thinking about what I want to share at the end of the day helps me
start with the end in mind.

**Figure**: My #screenshotsaturday progress
{: style="text-align: center;"}

Sharing on social media also encouraged me to [build with the garage door
open](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z21cgR9K3UcQ5a7yPsj2RUim3oM2TzdBByZu). At
first it's scary because I'm dipping my toes in new waters. But as time went
by, I gained confidence as I get to gauge people's reaction to my posts. You
can check the [full Twitter
thread](https://twitter.com/katsu_pxl/status/1368091736925380608?s=20) that I
used.

My tweets also acted like a dev log. Looking back, they now serve as a reminder
of how far I've come. It just started with simple raycasting, then some
enemies, and now I have a full game!  It feels good to be reminded that you're
improving, little by little&mdash; and it wouldn't be possible without a
consistent schedule.

## 3. Play with your strengths


<img style="float: right; margin:6px" width="380px"  src="/assets/png/abyss/mental_inventory.png">

Unlike traditional software development, **making a game involves a variety of
seemingly disparate skills.** It's not only about programming, but also art
and gameplay&mdash;a bit overwhelming if you ask me! However, if I want to finish my game
within three months ([see #1](#1-limit-your-scope)), I need to play with my strengths.

Before starting, I made a mental inventory of my skills against those required
for game development. Then, I assessed which ones I'm (1) confident doing, (2) willing
to learn, and (3) to just outsource. Here's what it looks like:

<!--

<br />
**Figure**: The more complex the task, the more time it takes to complete it
{: style="text-align: center;"}
-->


### Programming

I decided to use [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org/) because it's free,
resembles Python, and has batteries included: 

* *Free:* Godot is open-source, and I can just download it for free from Steam. 
* *Resembles Python:* I was able to be productive in Godot right away. 
* *Batteries included:* no need to reimplement complex algorithms (e.g., 
[RayCast2D](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_raycast2d.html#class-raycast2d)).

<!--

<!-- insert raycasting gif -->
![](/assets/png/abyss/fog_of_war.gif){:width="500px" style="border-radius:8px"}  
<br />
**Figure**: With Godot, I can just use the builtin raycasting algorithm to simulate
fog of war.
{: style="text-align: center;"}

At first, I tried using [Pico-8](https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php).
However, that means I need to write my own pathfinding and dungeon generation
algorithms. I'd love to, but it's not the point of this exercise. With Godot, I
can just import a class and configure it to my needs. 

Of course, I am not yet fluent in Godot. There are still some concepts that I
try to wrap my head around and best practices that I need to learn. For example,
[Nodes and
Scenes](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/getting_started/step_by_step/scenes_and_nodes.html)
took me some time,
[signals](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/getting_started/step_by_step/signals.html)
pattern is quite new, and
my [project
structure](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/getting_started/workflow/project_setup/project_organization.html)
is not yet idiomatic. 

In addition, there are cases when instead of solving things properly, I just
hacked my way out of it. Long way to go, but I'm happy with what I have so far!

### Art

For graphics, I opted to use pixel art. I've been learning for almost a year
now, and I feel confident in my abilities especially at lower dimensions (8x8
to 32x32). I chose [Comfort44s](https://lospec.com/palette-list/comfort44s) for
the color palette, then went for a retro aesthetic.

<!-- example of levels, screenshot -->

![](/assets/png/abyss/act2.png){:width="300px" height="180px" style="border-radius:8px; padding-bottom:6px"}

![](/assets/png/abyss/boss_fight.gif){:width="300px" height="180px" style="border-radius:8px;padding-bottom:6px"}  
{: style="text-align: center;"}


I borrowed some ideas from
[Celeste]((https://store.steampowered.com/app/504230/Celeste/)) when designing
my environment. For example, the lava in the final level was based
from ["Chapter 8: Core"](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Chapter_8:_Core)
while the overall feel of the dungeon came from ["Chapter 5: Mirror
Temple."](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Chapter_5:_Mirror_Temple) You can
see their influences in the tilesets below:

<!-- example of tilesets -->

![](/assets/png/abyss/CavernTileset.png){:width="300px" style="border-radius:8px"}
{: style="text-align: center;"}

As for my sprite work, I'd like to think that I was able to convey the look and
movement of my characters while ensuring that they stand out in the
environment. I'm proud of it!

<img style="float: right; border-radius:8px; margin:8px;" width="360px"  src="/assets/png/abyss/slash_animation.gif">

One of my favorites is the "slash animation" that I borrowed from [Hollow
Knight](https://store.steampowered.com/app/367520/Hollow_Knight/). Notice that
you'll only see the sword during the wind-down animation but the "crunchiness"
of the slash is rendered by the slash effect and the in-game screen shake:

{: style="text-align: center;"}
-->

### Music

To keep the retro style of the game, I decided to use chiptune for music. At
first I thought of producing my own. I tried learning how to use
[Milkytracker](https://milkytracker.org/) and went through some of [Gruber's
tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96CWDAWDzdk). However, it dawned on
me that I'll never be able to ship if I produce my own music, so instead I
just outsourced from [OpenGameArt](https://opengameart.org).

The music and sound effects came from
[SubspaceAudio](https://opengameart.org/content/4-chiptunes-adventure). Sure,
I'll probably learn how to make music in the future, but for now, using free
assets will do.  Thanks to [Juhani
Junkala](https://opengameart.org/users/subspaceaudio) for providing awesome
tunes!


## 4. Join a community of like-minded folks

**I can only go so far learning on my own.** If I want to keep my momentum even
after developing Abyss, then I need to join communities. I categorize them into
three types: (1) passive, (2) tool-based, and (3) active.

Passive communities are those that I don't actively participate in. A good
example of this is Twitter. I created a List that only follows pixel artists,
game developers, and publishers. This influenced my timeline into showing
tweets related to what I want. Here, I just passively consume information. 

Tool-based communities are Discord servers of my favorite tools. So far, I've
joined the
[Aseprite](https://community.aseprite.org/t/official-discord-server-for-aseprite/332),
[Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org/community), and [Bitsy
Talk](http://vaida.me/abitaboutbitsy/) servers.  With these communities, I was
able to ask questions, discover tutorials, and connect with fellow hobbyists. I
find it important to learn more about my tools, and improve how I use them.

Lastly, active communities are solely focused on game development itself. They
usually host game jams, streams, and other activities on the topic. Two of my
favorite ones are [PIGSquad (Portland Indie Game
Squad)](https://pigsquad.com/community), and BuddyGameDev. The atmosphere is
welcoming, and they cater to amateurs and professionals alike.

Surrounding myself with like-minded people helped me keep my momentum. I
get to ask for feedback, share my work, and connect with others. They inspired
me to finish the game, and to keep pursuing game development as a hobby!


## 5. Don't forget to have fun!

Earlier, I mentioned that my goal is to create a game that I myself will be
delighted to play. Since these are hobbies, *fun* and *delight*  serve
as strong signals. If I'm getting bored and burnt out because of it, then maybe
it's time to drop it off. 

In the process of developing my first game, I started to realize that I'm
making this for myself. Sure, I love sharing my work and would be excited if a
lot of people play it&mdash;but if I myself don't enjoy the process, then what is it
for? This reminds me of a quote from [my favorite Tom Scott
video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BxV14h0kFs0?t=516):

> The world can be better because of what you built in the past.
> They don't have to be big projects, *they might just have an audience of one.*
> And even if they don't last, try to make sure they leave something positive
> behind...*the code was never the important part.*

That's why I'm grateful for anyone who played and enjoyed my game. I see
this as an expression of myself and it's nice to see others partaking in it. I
am happy to be accompanied by you in this game dev journey. With that I say:

## Postscript

Last year, I realized that games are a good avenue of creative expression. I
played a lot of them, sometimes more intentionally. You can see it in my
[analysis of Celeste](/life/2020/08/22/scaling-celeste-mountain/), and in my
[end-of-year personal game awards](/life/2020/12/20/lj-game-awards-2020/).
They've inspired me to try them out as a medium for creativity.

However, making games is quite an undertaking. There's a lot to learn and it
felt overwhelming. Given that, I'm reminded by [this quote from another game
dev](https://twitter.com/johanpeitz/status/1268108172214046721?s=20):

> "Small moves Ellie, small moves"

<div align="center">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">”Small moves, Ellie, small moves.”</p>&mdash; Johan Peitz (@johanpeitz) <a href="https://twitter.com/johanpeitz/status/1268108172214046721?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 3, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div>

**I'd like to think that I'm making small moves.** It's good to have people to
look up to.  As of now, these are: [Daniel Linssen](https://managore.itch.io/), [Adamgryu](https://adamgryu.com/), and [Maddy Thorson](https://twitter.com/MaddyThorson)
for general game development, [Mark Sparling](https://marksparling.ca)[^3] and [Lena Raine](https://radicaldreamland.bandcamp.com/)[^4] for composition,
[Johan Peitz](https://johanpeitz.com/) and [Noel Berry](http://noelberry.ca/) for programming, and [Jen Zee](https://www.deviantart.com/jenzee) for art.

It's exciting to see what can be done at the highest levels of this craft, and
I can't wait to inch my way towards it! I'm still exploring different ways to
do game development although I already have a lot of game ideas on my mind.
**I'll still keep game development as a hobby**, and I'm curious to see how far
I can reach with little time and resources. 

For people who played my first game, thank you! For those who were with me
during the process, my deepest gratitude. On to the next one!

### Footnotes

[^1]: I am not sure who is the original author of this quote. Nevertheless, I concur. Learning is about intentionally producing a large volume of work. 
[^2]: According to the [Berlin Interpretation](http://www.roguebasin.com/index.php?title=Berlin_Interpretation), a *roguelike* has permadeath, turn-based, with elements of exploration and discovery.
[^3]: I really adored Mark Sparling's composition in [A Short Hike](https://ashorthike.com/). Also, [check out his Soundcloud!](https://soundcloud.com/marksparling) He used to make one chiptune everyday, intense!
[^4]: Lena Raine is a genius. Enough said.
