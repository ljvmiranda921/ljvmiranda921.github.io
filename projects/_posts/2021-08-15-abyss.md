<span class="firstcharacter">L</span>ast May, I published my first game on
[itch.io](https://ljvmiranda921.itch.io).
**[Abyss](https://ljvmiranda921.itch.io/abyss) is an action roguelike that
takes you into the depths as you battle monsters and foes!** *Who lurks deep
beneath? Find out here:*

I shared it to my friends and some game dev communities. They all complimented
the gameplay, enjoyed the choice of music, and loved the art style. Their
feedback made my entire year! It feels good to work on something, sharing it
out in the open, and receiving good reactions from it.

In this blogpost, I'll talk about **five lessons I learned from making my first
game.** Game development is a different beast! Even though I've been
programming professionally for three years now, there are still lessons I've
come to learn.

1. [Limit your scope](#1-limit-your-scope)
2. [Set a schedule and stick to it](#2-set-a-schedule-and-stick-to-it)
3. [Play with your strengths](#3-play-with-your-strengths)
4. [Share to the community](#4-share-to-the-community)
5. [Don't forget to have fun!](#5-dont-forget-to-have-fun)

I highly recommend **playing the game first before reading** the rest of the
post.  I'll talk about few design decisions that may be considered as *spoiler*
even if it's just a small game.


## 1. Limit your scope

As a famous saying goes: "your first ten games will suck, so get them out of
the way fast."[^1] For me, it stresses the importance of shipping, and **the
enemy of shipping is scope creep.** I want to finish a game and move on to the
next one.

> Your first ten games will suck, so get them out of the way fast

I work well with deadlines, so I gave myself ten weekends with two weeks of
buffer (approximately three months). I also want to keep it simple, yet rich in
variety. Given that timeframe, I kept my expectations low. I won't be making
the next AAA hit, **so I set my goal as: "make a game that I will be delighted to
play."**

> My goal: make a game that I myself will be delighted to play.

This led to my decision to create a roguelike.[^2] Looking back, I benefited
from this choice because:

* *I can piggyback on procedural generation:* I get a lot of variety for free.
* *It's tile-based:* no need to write physics, just simple four-directional motion.
* *It's almost infinitely replayable:* because of permadeath, I can focus on
    the core gameplay.

<br />
**Figure**: Three-act structure for my roguelike
{: style="text-align: center;"}

In addition, I chose roguelikes because of the games I played last
January&mdash;[Hades](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1145360/Hades/), [Dead
Cells](https://deadcells.fandom.com/wiki/Fatal_Falls_DLC), and [Slay the
Spire](https://store.steampowered.com/app/646570/Slay_the_Spire/) became my
inspiration. As for the content, I restricted myself into three acts and one
final boss. It's good enough to keep the scope tiny and content rich, while
establishing an end state. 


With the scope set, it's time to build!

## 2. Set a schedule and stick to it

My game won't create itself, so **I spent the weekends writing code and making
art.** Keeping a schedule forced me to be consistent, which in turn allowed short
feedback loops. This system built momentum, helping me finish the game.

One practice I found useful is participating in
[#screenshotsaturdays](https://twitter.com/hashtag/screenshotsaturdays), i.e.,
to post a screenshot of my progress on Twitter every weekend. It's good for
pacing: thinking about what I want to share at the end of the day helps me
start with the end in mind.

**Figure**: My #screenshotsaturday progress
{: style="text-align: center;"}

Sharing on social media also encourages [building in
public](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public/). At first it's scary because I'm
dipping my toes in new waters. But as time went by, I gained confidence as I
get to gauge people's reaction to my game. You can check the [full Twitter
thread](https://twitter.com/katsu_pxl/status/1368091736925380608?s=20) that I
used.

My tweets acted like a dev log. Looking back, they serve as a reminder of how
far I've come. It just started with simple raycasting, then some enemies, and
now I have a full game!  It feels good to be reminded that you're improving,
little by little&mdash; and it wouldn't be possible without a consistent
schedule.

## 3. Play with your strengths

Unlike traditional software development, **making a game involves a variety of
seemingly disparate skills.** It's not only about programming, but also art
and gameplay. It was overwhelming at first! However, if I want to finish my game
within scope ([see #1](#1-limit-your-scope)), I need to play with my strengths.

Before starting, I made a mental inventory of my skills against those required
for game development. Then, I assessed which ones I'm (1) confident doing, (2) willing
to learn, and (3) to just outsource. Here's what it looks like:

![](/assets/png/abyss/mental_inventory.png){:width="460px"}  
<br />
**Figure**: The more complex the task, the more time it takes to complete it
{: style="text-align: center;"}


### Programming

I decided to use [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org/) because it's free,
resembles Python, and has batteries included: 

* *Free:* Godot is open-source, and I can just download it for free from Steam. 
* *Resembles Python:* I was able to be productive in Godot right away. 
* *Batteries included:* no need to reimplement complex algorithms (e.g., 
[RayCast2D](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_raycast2d.html#class-raycast2d)).


<!-- insert raycasting gif -->

<br />
**Figure**: With Godot, I can just use the builtin raycasting algorithm to simulate
fog of war.
{: style="text-align: center;"}

Of course, I am not yet fluent in Godot. There are still some concepts that I
try to wrap my head around, and best practices that I need to learn. For example,
[Nodes and
Scenes](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/getting_started/step_by_step/scenes_and_nodes.html)
took me some time,
[signals](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/getting_started/step_by_step/signals.html)
pattern is quite new, and
my [project
structure](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/getting_started/workflow/project_setup/project_organization.html)
is not yet idiomatic. 

In addition, there are cases when instead of solving things properly, I just
hacked my way out of it. Long way to go, but I'm happy with what I have so far!

### Art

For graphics, I opted to use pixel art. I've been learning for almost a year
now, and I feel confident in my abilities especially at lower dimensions (8x8
to 32x32). I chose [Comfort44s](https://lospec.com/palette-list/comfort44s) for
the color palette, then went for a retro aesthetic.

<!-- example of levels, screenshot -->
![](/assets/png/abyss/act1.png){:width="320px" height="200px" style="border-radius:8px; padding-bottom:6px"}
![](/assets/png/abyss/act2.png){:width="320px" height="200px" style="border-radius:8px; padding-bottom:6px"}  
![](/assets/png/abyss/act3.png){:width="320px" height="200px" style="border-radius:8px;padding-bottom:6px"}
![](/assets/png/abyss/boss_fight.gif){:width="320px" height="200px" style="border-radius:8px;padding-bottom:6px"}  
{: style="text-align: center;"}


I borrowed some ideas from
[Celeste]((https://store.steampowered.com/app/504230/Celeste/)) when designing
my environment. For example, the look of the lava in the final level was based
from ["Chapter 8: Core"](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Chapter_8:_Core)
while the overall feel of the dungeon came from ["Chapter 5: Mirror
Temple."](https://celestegame.fandom.com/wiki/Chapter_5:_Mirror_Temple) You can
see their influences in the tilesets below:

<!-- example of tilesets -->
![](/assets/png/abyss/UndwldDemoTileset.png){:width="320px" style="border-radius:8px"}
![](/assets/png/abyss/CavernTileset.png){:width="320px" style="border-radius:8px"}
{: style="text-align: center;"}

As for my sprite work, I'd like to think that I was able to convey the look and
movement of my monsters while making them stand out in the environment. I'm
proud of it!

<!-- example of monsters GIF -->

One of my favorites is the "slash animation" borrowed from [Hollow
Knight](https://store.steampowered.com/app/367520/Hollow_Knight/). Notice that
you'll only see the sword during the wind-down animation but the "crunchiness"
of the slash is rendered by the slash effect and the in-game screen shake:

<!-- include character slash animation -->

{: style="text-align: center;"}
<!-- include final boss and character -->

### Music

To keep the retro style of the game, I decided to use chiptune for music. At
first I thought of producing my own. I tried learning how to use
[Milkytracker](https://milkytracker.org/) and went through some of [Gruber's
tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96CWDAWDzdk). However, it dawned on
me that I'll never be able to ship if I produce my own music, so instead I
just outsourced from [OpenGameArt](https://opengameart.org).

The music and sound effects came from
[SubspaceAudio](https://opengameart.org/content/4-chiptunes-adventure). Sure,
I'll probably learn how to make music in the future, but for now, using free
assets will do.  Thanks to [Juhani
Junkala](https://opengameart.org/users/subspaceaudio) for providing awesome
tunes!


<!--
Why
===
- I want to minimize the number of unknowns as much as possible

Creative Process
================
- Graphic: make a bar chart of uncertainty-level using Excalidraw
    - Art: mid, I am confident with my retro-pixel skills
    - Programming: high-mid, chose a programming language similar to Python
        - Initial idea was to use PICO-8, but a lot of learning curve
        - I just want to hack for now
    - Gameplay: low-mid, I am familiar with traditional roguelikes, but not too 
        familiar to understand their intricacies
    - Music: low, I don't know how to make music yet
Use each component as subsections?

## 4. Share to the community

<!--
I realized that it's very important for me to join communities of like minded
people. I shared it in roguelikedev, newbie game dev community, and in godot
showcase discord groups.

I like getting feedback from a lot people as much as possible so that I can
further improve my craft.

Image: show screenshots of feedback!
-->


## 5. Don't forget to have fun!

<!--
My litmus test is: will I play it?
My initial mindset when building my first game is that I'm making it for myself
It's ok if the only audience is you.

If you enjoy playing it, then that's already good enough
-->


## Final thoughts: "Small moves, Ellie, small moves"

<!--
I only decided to make games recently. It was never a "took a tech/CS degree
because I want to make games when I was a kid" story. During 2020, I realized
that games are a good avenue of creative expression. I wrote a lot about it in
my analysis of Celeste, and my end-of-year personal game awards.

I realized that making games is quite an undertaking. But I was inspired by
this tweet reply by Johan Peitz:



And yes, I'd like to think that I'm making small moves.


It's also good to have inspirations: Daniel linssen, adam le doux, johan peitz
For more accomplished people: adamgryu, mark sparling (music), lena raine
(music), kasavin (story), noel berry (programming).


I'm definitely still exploring different ways to do
stuff. I already have a lot of game ideas on my mind, and I'm keeping track of
them in my notebook. Learning how to make music and chiptune

### Footnotes

[^1]: I am not sure who is the original author of this quote. Nevertheless, I concur. Learning is about intentionally producing a large volume of work. 
[^2]: According to the [Berlin Interpretation](http://www.roguebasin.com/index.php?title=Berlin_Interpretation), a *roguelike* has permadeath, turn-based, with elements of exploration and discovery.
[^3]: Honestly it was offputting as well!
