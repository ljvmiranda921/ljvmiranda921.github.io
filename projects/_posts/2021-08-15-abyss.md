Last May, I published my first game and posted it on
[itch.io](https://ljvmiranda921.itch.io). The game is
[**Abyss**](https://ljvmiranda921.itch.io/abyss), an action roguelike that
takes you into the depths as you battle monsters and foes! **Try it out here** *(
works best on desktop and keyboard)*:

I shared it to my friends and in some game dev communities. They all
complimented my game, enjoyed the choice of music, and loved the art style. To
be honest, their feedback made my entire year! It feels good to work on
something, sharing it out in the open, and receiving good feedback from it.

I learned a lot during development. It seems like game dev is a different
beast! In this blogpost, I'll talk about **five lessons I learned from making
my first game.** Even if I've been programming professionally for three years
now, there's still lessons I've learned and relearned.

## 1. Limit your scope

<!-- 

Why
===
Motivation: important part for me is to ship. 
Your first ten games will suck, so get it out of the way immediately.

Creative Process
================
Creative process: roguelike, three levels, 1 boss
Why roguelike?

scope creep
prioritization

Advantage
=========
Advantage of limiting my scope, I get to publish

-->

## 2. Set a schedule and stick to it

<!-- 

Why
===
Consistency is important to keep the momentum going.
Good feedback loops



Creative Process
================
I spent my weekends building the game

I like sharing and talking about my work. And it gives
me some positive reinforcement. My short feedback loop:
screenshotsaturdays on twitter. At the end of the day, 
I share a screenshot of my work. Building in public.

Maybe: show GIFs, as things evolved? Maybe make it a short video
something? or a collection of GIFs? Let's see...

Advantage
=========
Consistency is king
-->


## 3. Play with your strengths

<!--
Why
===
- I want to minimize the number of unknowns as much as possible

Creative Process
================
- Graphic: make a bar chart of uncertainty-level using Excalidraw
    - Art: mid, I am confident with my retro-pixel skills
    - Programming: high-mid, chose a programming language similar to Python
        - Initial idea was to use PICO-8, but a lot of learning curve
        - I just want to hack for now
    - Gameplay: low-mid, I am familiar with traditional roguelikes, but not too 
        familiar to understand their intricacies
    - Music: low, I don't know how to make music yet
Use each component as subsections?
-->


## 4. Share to the community

<!--
I realized that it's very important for me to join communities of like minded
people. I shared it in roguelikedev, newbie game dev community, and in godot
showcase discord groups.

I like getting feedback from a lot people as much as possible so that I can
further improve my craft.

Image: show screenshots of feedback!
-->


## 5. Don't forget to have fun!

<!--
My litmus test is: will I play it?
My initial mindset when building my first game is that I'm making it for myself
It's ok if the only audience is you.

If you enjoy playing it, then that's already good enough
-->


## "Small moves, Ellie, small moves"

<!--
I only decided to make games recently. It was never a "took a tech/CS degree
because I want to make games when I was a kid" story. During 2020, I realized
that games are a good avenue of creative expression. I wrote a lot about it in
my analysis of Celeste, and my end-of-year personal game awards.

I realized that making games is quite an undertaking. But I was inspired by
this tweet reply by Johan Peitz:



And yes, I'd like to think that I'm making small moves.


It's also good to have inspirations: Daniel linssen, adam le doux, johan peitz
For more accomplished people: adamgryu, mark sparling (music), lena raine
(music), kasavin (story), noel berry (programming).


I'm definitely still exploring different ways to do
stuff. I already have a lot of game ideas on my mind, and I'm keeping track of
them in my notebook. Learning how to make music and chiptune

Thank you message here..
