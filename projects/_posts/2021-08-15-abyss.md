<span class="firstcharacter">L</span>ast May, I published my first game on
[itch.io](https://ljvmiranda921.itch.io).
**[Abyss](https://ljvmiranda921.itch.io/abyss) is an action roguelike that
takes you into the depths as you battle monsters and foes!** *Who lurks deep
beneath? Find out here:*

<b>Instructions</b><br>
Use directional keys or WASD to move. Works best on Chrome and in your
desktop. You can also download executables for MacOS and Linux in the <a href="https://ljvmiranda921.itch.io/abyss">itch.io page</a>. <i>Note: loading may take a while.</i>
</p>

I shared it to my friends and some game dev communities. They all complimented
the gameplay, enjoyed the choice of music, and loved the art style. Their
feedback made my entire year! It feels good to work on something, sharing it
out in the open, and receiving good reactions from it.

In this blogpost, I'll talk about **five lessons I learned from making my first
game.** Game development is a different beast! Even though I've been
programming professionally for three years now, there are still lessons I've
come to learn.

## 1. Limit your scope

As a famous saying goes: "your first ten games will suck, so get them out of
the way fast."[^1] For me, it stresses the importance of shipping, and **the
enemy of shipping is scope creep.** I want to finish a game and move on to the
next one.

> Your first ten games will suck, so get them out of the way fast

I work well with deadlines, so I gave myself ten weekends with two weeks of
buffer (approximately three months). I also want to keep it simple, yet rich in
variety. Given that timeframe, I kept my expectations low. I won't be making
the next AAA hit, so I set my goal as: "make a game that I will be delighted to
play."

> My goal: make a game that I myself will be delighted to play.


This led to my decision to create a roguelike.[^2] Looking back, I benefited
from this choice because:

* *I can piggyback on procedural generation:* I get a lot of variety for free.
* *It's tile-based:* no need to write physics, just simple four-directional motion.
* *It's almost infinitely replayable:* because of permadeath, I can focus on
    the core gameplay.

<!-- add excalidraw of your plans maybe? -->


In addition, I chose roguelikes because of the games I played last
January&mdash;[Hades](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1145360/Hades/), [Dead
Cells](https://deadcells.fandom.com/wiki/Fatal_Falls_DLC), and [Slay the
Spire](https://store.steampowered.com/app/646570/Slay_the_Spire/) became my
inspiration. As for the content, I restricted myself into three acts and one
final boss. It's good enough to keep the scope tiny and content rich, while
establishing an end state. 


With the scope set, it's time to build!

## 2. Set a schedule and stick to it

My game won't create itself, so **I spent the weekends writing code and making
art.** Keeping a schedule forced me to be consistent, which in turn allowed short
feedback loops. This system built momentum, helping me finish the game.

One practice I found useful is participating in
[#screenshotsaturdays](https://twitter.com/hashtag/screenshotsaturdays), i.e.,
to post a screenshot of my progress on Twitter every weekend. It's good for
pacing: thinking about what I want to share at the end of the day helps me
start with the end in mind.

Sharing on social media also encourages [building in
public](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public/). At first it's scary because I'm
dipping my toes in new waters. But as time went by, I gained confidence as I
get to gauge people's reaction to my game. You can check the [full Twitter
thread](https://twitter.com/katsu_pxl/status/1368091736925380608?s=20) that I
used.

My tweets acted like a dev log. Looking back, they serve as a reminder of how
far I've come. It just started with simple raycasting, then some enemies, and
now I have a full game!  It feels good to be reminded that you're improving,
little by little&mdash; and it wouldn't be possible without a consistent
schedule.

## 3. Play with your strengths



### Art and music

### Programming

### Gameplay


<!--
Why
===
- I want to minimize the number of unknowns as much as possible

Creative Process
================
- Graphic: make a bar chart of uncertainty-level using Excalidraw
    - Art: mid, I am confident with my retro-pixel skills
    - Programming: high-mid, chose a programming language similar to Python
        - Initial idea was to use PICO-8, but a lot of learning curve
        - I just want to hack for now
    - Gameplay: low-mid, I am familiar with traditional roguelikes, but not too 
        familiar to understand their intricacies
    - Music: low, I don't know how to make music yet
Use each component as subsections?

## 4. Share to the community

<!--
I realized that it's very important for me to join communities of like minded
people. I shared it in roguelikedev, newbie game dev community, and in godot
showcase discord groups.

I like getting feedback from a lot people as much as possible so that I can
further improve my craft.

## 5. Don't forget to have fun!

<!--
My litmus test is: will I play it?
My initial mindset when building my first game is that I'm making it for myself
It's ok if the only audience is you.

If you enjoy playing it, then that's already good enough
-->


## Final thoughts: "Small moves, Ellie, small moves"

<!--
I only decided to make games recently. It was never a "took a tech/CS degree
because I want to make games when I was a kid" story. During 2020, I realized
that games are a good avenue of creative expression. I wrote a lot about it in
my analysis of Celeste, and my end-of-year personal game awards.

I realized that making games is quite an undertaking. But I was inspired by
this tweet reply by Johan Peitz:



And yes, I'd like to think that I'm making small moves.


It's also good to have inspirations: Daniel linssen, adam le doux, johan peitz
For more accomplished people: adamgryu, mark sparling (music), lena raine
(music), kasavin (story), noel berry (programming).


I'm definitely still exploring different ways to do
stuff. I already have a lot of game ideas on my mind, and I'm keeping track of
them in my notebook. Learning how to make music and chiptune

### Footnotes

[^1]: I am not sure who is the original author of this quote. Nevertheless, I concur. Learning is about intentionally producing a large volume of work. 
[^2]: According to the [Berlin Interpretation](http://www.roguebasin.com/index.php?title=Berlin_Interpretation), a *roguelike* has permadeath, turn-based, with elements of exploration and discovery.
