Last May, I published my first game and posted it on
[itch.io](https://ljvmiranda921.itch.io). The game is
[**Abyss**](https://ljvmiranda921.itch.io/abyss), an action roguelike that
takes you into the depths as you battle monsters and foes! **Try it out here** *(
works best on desktop and keyboard)*:

I shared it to my friends and in some game dev communities. They all
complimented my game, enjoyed the choice of music, and loved the art style. To
be honest, their feedback made my entire year! It feels good to work on
something, sharing it out in the open, and receiving good feedback from it.

I learned a lot during development. It seems like game dev is a different
beast! In this blogpost, I'll talk about **five lessons I learned from making
my first game.** Even if I've been programming professionally for three years
now, there's still lessons I've learned and relearned.
