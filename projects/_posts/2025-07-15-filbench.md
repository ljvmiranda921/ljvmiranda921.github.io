<span class="firstcharacter">A</span>t the end of 2024, I wrote about several [missing pieces in Filipino NLP](/notebook/2024/12/17/filipino-llm/).
One of which is **evaluation**.
I said that most of "how we measure LLM capabilities in Filipino are anecdotal: we post a screenshot of ChatGPT writing in Filipino and claim that it alredy has that capability&mdash;we need a systematic approach to evaluating these models."
Fast forward to today, I'm happy that we are now inching towards systematic evaluations for Filipino.
Hence, I would like to introduce **FilBench**!

## Filipino (and SEA) LLM evals are booming

## FilBench is opinionated in what it's testing

## A truly grassroots effort

## What's next?
