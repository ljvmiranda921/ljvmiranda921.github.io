<span class="firstcharacter">I</span> am excited to introduce [**calamanCy**](https://github.com/ljvmiranda921/calamanCy), an open-source toolkit for constructing natural language processing (NLP) pipelines for Tagalog.
It is built on top of [spaCy](https://spacy.io) to ensure easy experimentation and integration with other frameworks.
It provides general-purpose multitask models with out-of-the-box support for dependency parsing, part-of-speech (POS) tagging, and named entity recognition (NER).
The repository is available [on Github](https://github.com/ljvmiranda921/calamanCy), while the models are also accessible in [Huggingface](https://huggingface.co/ljvmiranda921).

More importantly, calamanCy aims to accelerage the progress of Tagalog NLP by consolidating disjointed resources in a unified framework.
In this blog post, I want to talk about the problem it's trying to solve, my process on building the framework, some benchmarks, and future work.
