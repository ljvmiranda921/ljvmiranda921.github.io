> *March 2021*&mdash;This blogpost underwent **major revisions**. Instead of just describing what
> Cellular Sprites is about, I want to talk about my **creative process** and
> motivation&mdash; from Seagull to Sprites-as-a-Service&mdash;and explore some
> underlying themes in between.

## Introduction

<!-- 
- i want to explore the idea of multiple discrete entities working together to form
something greater than the sum of its parts
- self-organization


Ender: sprites-as-a-service is a culmination of this exploration. 

-->

## Sprites-as-a-Service

### Seed(): building foundations through Seagull

<!-- talk about seagull -->

### Explore(): thematic explorations with Cellular Sprites

<!-- 
I know that I want interactivity and variability.
-->

### Optimize(): further refinement in Sprites-as-a-Service

<!--
Sprites as a service as a refinement of cellular sprites
- Not just using streamlit, i'm using a dedicated frontend
- More attuned to its brand and packaging
-->


## Conclusion

<!--
I admit that surfacing these themes were done in retrospect. I'm not fully
conscious of this eventual goal when building sprites-as-a-service. Connecting
dots in a line, etc.
