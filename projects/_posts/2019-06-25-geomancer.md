<span class="firstcharacter">L</span>ast Tuesday, I gave a talk at Databeers
Manila at the [Asian Institute of Management](https://www.aim.edu/) about
[Geomancer](https://github.com/thinkingmachines/geomancer), an open-source
library that I helped build. So I figured it best to talk about the project
through my slides and give a deeper context to some of the library's design.

## Why build Geomancer?

Through some of our geospatial client work, we saw how informative a single
coordinate could be. When taken together, we can extract patterns that can help
us with tasks like wealth estimation, building detection, and hub estimation.
However, a significant prerequisite involves getting useful machine learning
features to train statistical models.[^1]

{: style="text-align: center;"}


**Feature engineering** is a common task in machine learning. It involves
transforming raw data into features that data scientists can use for statistical learning
techniques. Unfortunately, there is no easy way to do these as of late.
Most require extensive knowledge of geospatial tools like
[QGIS](https://www.qgis.org/en/site/) or
[ArcGIS](https://www.arcgis.com/home/index.html). These techniques also don't
work well at scale: workflows can be complicated and costly in compute and
storage.

{: style="text-align: center;"}

[Geomancer](https://github.com/thinkingmachines/geomancer/) aims to bridge that gap by providing a Python library and a framework
to set up a geospatial feature engineering system.

{: style="text-align: center;"}

## What can Geomancer do?

[Geomancer](https://github.com/thinkingmachines/geomancer/) allows users to quickly define features, connect to multiple data
warehouses, and share or reproduce features. For example, data scientists need only to
interact with the `geomancer` Python library, while data engineers set up the
backend connection to the data warehouse.

Given a set of lat-long coordinates, users define a
[`Spell`](https://geomancer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/geomancer.spells.html#module-geomancer.spells)
to **create features declaratively**. These are the building blocks of the
library. For example, a spell can be a distance to the nearest point of interest (POI), the number of
POIs within a set length, and more!

![](/assets/png/geomancer/features.png){:width="560px"}  
{: style="text-align: center;"}

For example, we want to get the distance to the nearest embassy for several points. We first transform our list of coordinates into a Pandas DataFrame, then define a spell from the `DistanceToNearest` primitive. Finally, we pass the name of the POI, the data warehouse source (more on that later), and the name of the resulting feature:

```python
from geomancer.spells import DistanceToNearest
import pandas as pd

# Dataframe of coordinates with columns 'latitude' and `longitude'
my_coords = pd.read_csv("coordinates.csv")

spell = DistanceToNearest("embassy",
    source_table="bigquery_osm_table",
    feature_name="dist_embassy",
)
```

We can then
[`cast`](https://geomancer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/geomancer.spells.html#geomancer.spells.base.Spell.cast)
this
[`Spell`](https://geomancer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/geomancer.spells.html#module-geomancer.spells)
on the DataFrame to obtain a new one with the feature, `dist_embassy`, in another column.

```python
output_df = spell.cast(my_coords)
```

Getting single features might be a hassle, so the library also has a way to
group features (`Spells`) into a collection via a
[`SpellBook`](https://geomancer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/geomancer.spellbook.html).
You can also serialize features into a JSON file for **sharing and
reproducibility**.


![](/assets/png/geomancer/repro.png){:width="560px"}  
{: style="text-align: center;"}

Suppose after our analysis, we realized that the distance to primary
roads and the number of nearby supermarkets are good indicators for estimating
wealth. We can collect these features into a `SpellBook`, and then
export it as a JSON file:

```python
from geomancer.spells import DistanceToNearest, NumberOf
from geomancer.spellbook import SpellBook

spellbook = SpellBook(
             spells=[
                DistanceToNearest(
                    "primary",
                    source_table="bigquery_osm_table",
                    feature_name="dist_primary"
                ),
                NumberOf(
                    "supermarket"
                    source_table="bigquery_osm_table",
                    feature_name="num_supermarkets"
                ),
             ])

spellbook.author = "Juan dela Cruz"
spellbook.description = "Good features for economic indicators"
spellbook.to_json("features.json")
```

We can then send these features to another data scientist so that they can try it out in their own set of coordinates (maybe to verify it in another location or country):

```python
from geomancer.spellbook import SpellBook
import pandas as pd

coords = pd.read_csv("country_coords.csv")

spellbook = SpellBook.read_json("features.json")
df_with_features = spellbook.cast(coords)
```


[Geomancer](https://github.com/thinkingmachines/geomancer) obtains these
features because it's **connected to a data warehouse** (in the above case, it's
[BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery)). Most geospatial datasets are
stored in these large [OLAP databases](https://www.ibm.com/topics/olap), and
[Geomancer](https://github.com/thinkingmachines/geomancer) takes advantage of
their storage and compute capabilities. Currently, the library has drivers for
BigQuery, [PostGIS](https://postgis.net/), and
[SpatiaLite](https://www.gaia-gis.it/fossil/libspatialite/index).

{: style="text-align: center;"}

And that's it for the library portion of [Geomancer!](https://github.com/thinkingmachines/geomancer) You can install `geomancer` via `pip`, and start casting spells your way! In the next section, I'll discuss the framework's architecture and layout. 
It's an interesting read if you want to know more how we set up [Geomancer](https://github.com/thinkingmachines/geomancer) in [Thinking Machines](https://thinkingmachin.es).

{: style="text-align: center;"}

## Architecture

There are two main components for
[Geomancer](https://github.com/thinkingmachines/geomancer): the Python library
and the geospatial data warehouse. You can think of
[Geomancer](https://github.com/thinkingmachines/geomancer) as a glorified
database query writer. The Python library allows us to abstract away the need to
write complicated SQL queries and spend time setting up and configuring
databases.

![](/assets/png/geomancer/architecture.png){:width="720px"}  
{: style="text-align: center;"}

Starting from left to right:
- The **interface** is a standard Python library. Its **backend** is run via the [SQLAlchemy engine](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/), which allows us to combine and group queries without the hassle of a templating engine. We extended the [SQLAlchemy Core](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/20/core/) with the databases we support. This process will enable us to write dialects (i.e., different variations of the SQL language) to our liking.
- The **geospatial data warehouse** stores the datasets we have. In the example above, you can see this referenced as `bigquery_osm_table`. We set up pipelines to obtain data from **external sources** such as [Geofabrik](https://www.geofabrik.de/) and [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/), plus some of our proprietary data sources.

I like this setup because there's a clear delineation between a data
scientist's and a data engineer's roles. As a result, they both do what they do best: the former
on engineering features and the latter on setting up pipelines.

## <a id="postscript"></a>Conclusion (Postscript)

> Updated November 2022: I rewrote the conclusion to fit my current thoughts on the project.

Unfortunately, we discontinued development on Geomancer because of several
factors: I got busy with client work, I managed a team, and the use cases might
be smaller than I imagined. Development stalled and went to a halt.  I also
handled more prominent consulting clients back then, so I could only focus a
little on internal open-source work.

Nevertheless, two years after Geomancer, I learned a lot about the
non-engineering side of software engineering. Sure, I think my technical
knowledge has grown, but the invisible parts of developing software revealed
themselves to me:

- Time is money. We spent a lot of time developing it that there should always
be a relevant business case to "break even." This can be in the form of a client
project that demonstrates the tool or a SaaS. We don't practice the latter, and
we can't find the former, so it was a cost deficit in the end.
- Don't be attached to your code. The younger version of me still has an
unhealthy relationship with my passion; seeing things not work out bums me out.
I have reflected on this recently, see ["my personal framework for
flourishing."](/life/2021/09/21/build-earn-play/) Sometimes, the business
strategy changes, and your work may not be part of it.
- Learn to market. Before, the development of Geomancer was done by a small
group of volunteers. As we all got busy, we deprioritized open-source work for
more money-generating activities (business development, client work, etc.). I
still believe in the importance of this tool, but I think I failed to market it
properly.

Lastly, I learned that I love working in open-source! Open-source software was
my gateway to programming back in 2017, and five years down the line, it's still
something I enjoy. I decided to devote myself to open-source when the
opportunity presented itself, so I accepted an offer to work at
[spaCy](https://spacy.io). Initially, I was planning to go back to Ateneo to
prep for my Ph.D., but the *winds of change*![^2]

I'm also grateful to [Thinking Machines](https://thinkingmachin.es) for giving
me the space to develop this library and to various volunteers who helped me
build it. *Thank you!* I wrote this postscript because I want to bookend this
experience on a good note.[^3] I don't think Geomancer was successful. But at
least I can close that chapter with finality. It sucks, but such is life. The
Github repository for [Geomancer](https://github.com/thinkingmachines/geomancer)
is now archived.  [Thinking Machines](https://thinkingmachin.es) is currently
working on another geospatial tool,
[Geowrangler](https://github.com/thinkingmachines/geowrangler). I wish this new
project success!

    We want to differentiate between geospatial and machine learning features. They're the same term but refer to different things. *Geospatial features* include coordinates, attributes, and temporal information. We can consider the features extracted by Geomancer as a derivation of geospatial features.

    My favorite poem on change and fate is from [Ella Wheeler Wilcox's *The Winds of Fate*](http://www.ellawheelerwilcox.org/poems/pwindsof.htm). Curiously, I discovered it from a Magic: The Gathering card, [*Winds of Change*](https://gatherer.wizards.com/pages/card/details.aspx?multiverseid=1598)!

    I was also inspired by Seiya Tokui's [reflections on
    Chainer](https://www.beam2d.net/blog/2019/12/10/chainer-look-back-en/). A
    few years ago, [Preferred Networks](https://www.preferred.jp/en/) shifted
    from using [Chainer](https://chainer.org/) (their in-house neural net
    framework) to [Pytorch](https://pytorch.org/). I know Geomancer is not as 
    big as Chainer, but I definitely feel for Tokui-san's post.
