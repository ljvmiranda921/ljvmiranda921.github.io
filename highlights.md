Here is a curated list of content, organized by topic.


## NLP and Computational Linguistics
NLP and computational linguistics are my primary research interests. I'm particularly into
multilingual NLP, information retrieval and extraction, and low-resource languages.

- [Dependency parsing for a low-resource language (Tagalog)](/notebook/2022/04/24/low-resource-dep-parse/)
- [Your train-test split may be doing you a disservice](/notebook/2022/08/02/splits/)
- [A framework for designing document processing solutions](/notebook/2022/06/19/document-processing-framework/)

As a spaCy developer, there are parts of the spaCy codebase that I find
interesting. Here are some of my independent explorations of these aspects.

- [spaCy Internals: Spancat architecture walkthrough](/notebook/2022/07/16/spacy-registry/)
- [spaCy Internals: configuration and project system](/notebook/2021/11/20/spacy-v3/)

Some select topics as I go through NLP and linguistics courses. I try to make
them beginner-friendly, so just read on!

- [Study notes on regular expressions and finite state automata](/notebook/2022/10/07/finite-state-automata/)
- [Study notes on making word vectors from scratch](/notebook/2021/12/11/word-vectors/)


## Machine Learning Engineering and MLOps
I'm also interested in the practical application of machine learning to non-trivial problems. I find the
intersection of software engineering and ML to be an exciting space, so I made a lot of notes about it!

- [Navigating the MLOps landscape (three-part series)](/notebook/2021/05/10/navigating-the-mlops-landscape/)
- [How to improve software engineering skills as a researcher](/notebook/2020/11/15/data-science-swe/)
- [Towards data-centric machine learning: a short review](/notebook/2021/07/30/data-centric-ml/)
- [How to use Jupyter Notebooks in 2020](/notebook/2020/03/06/jupyter-notebooks-in-2020/) *(a bit deprecated)*
- [Why do we need Flask, Celery, and Redis?](/notebook/2019/11/08/flask-redis-celery-mcdo/)

## Game Development
I'm a hobbyist game dev and I love creating pixel art games. I am also a fan of
the Godot Engine and Pico-8. Play my games by visiting my [**itch.io
page**](https://ljvmiranda921.itch.io).

- [What are Nodes and Scenes in Godot? A cooking perspective](/notebook/2021/04/19/godot-nodes-and-scenes/)
- [Study notes on Pico-8 movement](/notebook/2021/01/31/pico8-offset/)
